Manufacturing comprises enclave-type assembly for export with major products being bedding, handicrafts, and electronic components. Prospects for economic growth in the medium term will continue to depend on tourist arrivals from the US, Canada, and Europe and potential damages from natural disasters. After taking office in 2004, the SPENCER government adopted an ambitious fiscal reform program, and was successful in reducing its public debt-to-GDP ratio from 120% to about 90% in 2008. However, the global financial crisis that began in 2008, has led to a significant increase in the national debt, which topped 130% at the end of 2010. The Antiguan economy experienced solid growth from 2003 to 2007, reaching over 12% in 2006 driven by a construction boom in hotels and housing associated with the Cricket World Cup, but growth dropped off in 2008 with the end of the boom. In 2009, Antigua's economy was severely hit by the global economic crisis, suffering from the collapse of its largest financial institution and a steep decline in tourism. This decline continued in 2010 as the country struggled with a yawning budget deficit.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":1425000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":1105000000},"GDP - real growth rate":"-4.1% (2010 est.)","GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":3.8,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":22,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":74.3,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":30000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":7,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":11,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":82,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":11,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":"NA%","highest 10%:":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":229500000},"expenditures:":{"usd":293400000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1.5,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":6.5,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":10.07,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":233500000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":1186000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":1130000000},"Agriculture - products":"cotton, fruits, vegetables, bananas, coconuts, cucumbers, mangoes, sugarcane; livestock","Industries":"tourism, construction, light manufacturing (clothing, alcohol, household appliances)","Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Electricity - production":{"quantity":110000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":102300000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":5000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":219,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":4690,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-211 million (2007 est.)","Exports":{"usd":84300000},"Exports - commodities":"petroleum products, bedding, handicrafts, electronic components, transport equipment, food and live animals","Imports":{"usd":522799999.99999994},"Imports - commodities":"food and live animals, machinery and transport equipment, manufactures, chemicals, oil","Debt - external":{"usd":359800000},"Exchange rates":"East Caribbean dollars (XCD) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"ae","name":"United Arab Emirates","region":"Middle East","background":"The Trucial States of the Persian Gulf coast granted the UK control of their defense and foreign affairs in 19th century treaties.

Successful efforts at economic diversification have reduced the portion of GDP based on oil and gas output to 25%. Since the discovery of oil in the UAE more than 30 years ago, the UAE has undergone a profound transformation from an impoverished region of small desert principalities to a modern state with a high standard of living. The government has increased spending on job creation and infrastructure expansion and is opening up utilities to greater private sector involvement. In April 2004, the UAE signed a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement with Washington and in November 2004 agreed to undertake negotiations toward a Free Trade Agreement with the US, however, those talks have not moved forward. The country's Free Trade Zones - offering 100% foreign ownership and zero taxes - are helping to attract foreign investors. The global financial crisis, tight international credit, and deflated asset prices constricted the economy in 2009 and 2010. UAE authorities tried to blunt the crisis by increasing spending and boosting liquidity in the banking sector. The crisis hit Dubai hardest, as it was heavily exposed to depressed real estate prices. Dubai lacked sufficient cash to meet its debt obligations, prompting global concern about its solvency. The UAE Central Bank and Abu Dhabi-based banks bought the largest shares. In December 2009 Dubai received an additional $10 billion loan from the emirate of Abu Dhabi. The economy is expected to continue a slow rebound. Dependence on oil, a large expatriate workforce, and growing inflation pressures are significant long-term challenges. The UAE's strategic plan for the next few years focuses on diversification and creating more opportunities for nationals through improved education and increased private sector employment.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":246800000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":301900000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":3.2,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":0.9,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":51.5,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":47.6,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":{"Labor force":3908000,"country comparison to the world:":""},"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":7,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":15,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":78,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":2.4,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":19.5,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":"NA%","highest 10%:":"NA%"},"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":26.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":65019999999.99999},"expenditures:":{"usd":60020000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":44.6,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":2.2,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":"NA%","Stock of narrow money":{"usd":68760000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":228500000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":290000000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":109600000000},"Agriculture - products":"dates, vegetables, watermelons; poultry, eggs, dairy products; fish","Industries":"petroleum and petrochemicals; fishing, aluminum, cement, fertilizers, commercial ship repair, construction materials, some boat building, handicrafts, textiles","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":3.2,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":71540000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":65980000000.00001,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":2798000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":435000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":2700000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":192900,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":97800000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":50240000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":59420000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":7567000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":16750000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":6071000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":3409000000},"Exports":{"usd":195800000000},"Exports - commodities":"crude oil 45%, natural gas, reexports, dried fish, dates","Exports - partners":"Japan 17.27%, South Korea 10.49%, India 9.96%, Iran 6.82%, Thailand 5.11% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":159000000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery and transport equipment, chemicals, food","Imports - partners":"China 15.03%, India 14.27%, US 8.44%, Germany 5.81%, Japan 4.52% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":39100000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":122700000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":76380000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":54910000000},"Exchange rates":"Emirati dirhams (AED) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"af","name":"Afghanistan","region":"South Asia","background":"Ahmad Shah DURRANI unified the Pashtun tribes and founded Afghanistan in 1747.

The Soviet Union invaded in 1979 to support the tottering Afghan Communist regime, touching off a long and destructive war. The USSR withdrew in 1989 under relentless pressure by internationally supported anti-Communist mujahedin rebels. A series of subsequent civil wars saw Kabul finally fall in 1996 to the Taliban, a hardline Pakistani-sponsored movement that emerged in 1994 to end the country's civil war and anarchy. Following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C., a US, Allied, and anti-Taliban Northern Alliance military action toppled the Taliban for sheltering Osama BIN LADIN. The UN-sponsored Bonn Conference in 2001 established a process for political reconstruction that included the adoption of a new constitution, a presidential election in 2004, and National Assembly elections in 2005. In December 2004, Hamid KARZAI became the first democratically elected president of Afghanistan and the National Assembly was inaugurated the following December. KARZAI was re-elected in August 2009 for a second term.

The economy has improved significantly since the fall of the Taliban regime in 2001 largely because of the infusion of international assistance, the recovery of the agricultural sector, and service sector growth. Despite the progress of the past few years, Afghanistan is extremely poor, landlocked, and highly dependent on foreign aid, agriculture, and trade with neighboring countries. Much of the population continues to suffer from shortages of housing, clean water, electricity, medical care, and jobs. Criminality, insecurity, weak governance, and the Afghan Government's inability to extend rule of law to all parts of the country pose challenges to future economic growth. Afghanistan's living standards are among the lowest in the world. While the international community remains committed to Afghanistan's development, pledging over $67 billion at four donors' conferences since 2002, the Government of Afghanistan will need to overcome a number of challenges, including low revenue collection, anemic job creation, high levels of corruption, weak government capacity, and poor public infrastructure.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":27360000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":15610000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":8.2,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":31,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":26,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":43,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":15000000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":78.6,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":5.7,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":15.7,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":35,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":36,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":"NA%","highest 10%:":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":1000000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":3300000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":13.3,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":15,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":3943000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":4149000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":363600000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Agriculture - products":"opium, wheat, fruits, nuts; wool, mutton, sheepskins, lambskins","Industries":"small-scale production of textiles, soap, furniture, shoes, fertilizer, apparel, food-products, non-alcoholic beverages, mineral water, cement; handwoven carpets; natural gas, coal, copper","Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Electricity - production":{"quantity":285500000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":231100000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":230000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":5000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":4404,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":30000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":30000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":49550000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-2.475 billion (2009 est.)","Exports":{"Exports":{"usd":547000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Exports - commodities":"opium, fruits and nuts, handwoven carpets, wool, cotton, hides and pelts, precious and semi-precious gems","Exports - partners":"US 26.47%, India 23.09%, Pakistan 17.36%, Tajikistan 12.51% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":5300000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery and other capital goods, food, textiles, petroleum products","Imports - partners":"Pakistan 26.78%, US 24.81%, India 5.15%, Germany 5.06%, Russia 4.04% (2009)","Debt - external":{"usd":2700000000},"Exchange rates":"afghanis (AFA) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"ag","name":"Algeria","region":"Africa","background":"After more than a century of rule by France, Algerians fought through much of the 1950s to achieve independence in 1962. Algeria's primary political party, the National Liberation Front (FLN), was established in 1954 as part of the struggle for independence and has largely dominated politics since. The Government of Algeria in 1988 instituted a multi-party system in response to public unrest, but the surprising first round success of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) in the December 1991 balloting spurred the Algerian army to intervene and postpone the second round of elections to prevent what the secular elite feared would be an extremist-led government from assuming power. The army began a crackdown on the FIS that spurred FIS supporters to begin attacking government targets, and fighting escalated into an insurgency, which saw intense violence between 1992-98 resulting in over 100,000 deaths - many attributed to indiscriminate massacres of villagers by extremists. The government gained the upper hand by the late-1990s, and FIS's armed wing, the Islamic Salvation Army, disbanded in January 2000. Abdelaziz BOUTEFLIKA, with the backing of the military, won the presidency in 1999 in an election widely viewed as fraudulent. He was reelected to a second term in 2004, and overwhelmingly won a third term in 2009 after the government amended the constitution in 2008 to remove presidential term limits. Longstanding problems continue to face BOUTEFLIKA, including large-scale unemployment, a shortage of housing, unreliable electrical and water supplies, government inefficiencies and corruption, and the continuing activities of extremist militants. The Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC) in 2006 merged with al-Qai'da to form al-Qai'da in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb, which has launched an ongoing series of kidnappings and bombings targeting the Algerian Government and Western interests. The Arab uprising across the Near Eastern and North African region beginning in December 2010, coupled with a sudden rise in the cost of food staples, triggered a wave of protests across Algeria during early 2011. Organizers of many of these protests included opposition political parties, labor and trade unions, and human rights organizations. The government's initial response to protester demands included lifting the 19-year state of emergency laws and temporarily cutting taxes and duties on selected food items, but demonstrators continued to attempt to organize protests. An overwhelming Algerian police response managed to contain most demonstrations with some reports of violence. In mid-April 2011, President BOUTEFLIKA said he would seek to amend the nation's constitution to reinforce representative democracy, propose changes to the election laws, and submit the proposals for national referendum.","geo":{"Location":"Northern Africa, bordering the Mediterranean Sea, between Morocco and Tunisia","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":28,"min":0},"E":{"deg":3,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total:":{"quantity":2381,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world:":"","land:":{"quantity":2381,"unit":"sq km"},"water:":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly less than 3.5 times the size of Texas","Land boundaries":{"total:":{"quantity":6343,"unit":"km"},"border countries:":"Libya 982 km, Mali 1,376 km, Mauritania 463 km, Morocco 1,559 km, Niger 956 km, Tunisia 965 km, Western Sahara 42 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":998,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea:":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive fishing zone:":"32-52 nm"},"Climate":"arid to semiarid;

Gradual liberalization since the mid-1990s has opened up more of the economy, but in recent years Algeria has imposed new restrictions on foreign involvement in its economy and largely halted the privatization of state-owned industries. Hydrocarbons have long been the backbone of the economy, accounting for roughly 60% of budget revenues, 30% of GDP, and over 95% of export earnings. Algeria has the eighth-largest reserves of natural gas in the world and is the fourth-largest gas exporter. It ranks 16th in oil reserves. Thanks to strong hydrocarbon revenues, Algeria has a cushion of $150 billion in foreign currency reserves and a large hydrocarbon stabilization fund. In addition, Algeria's external debt is extremely low at about 1% of GDP. Algeria has struggled to develop industries outside of hydrocarbons in part because of high costs and an inert state bureaucracy. The government's efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy sector have done little to reduce high poverty and youth unemployment rates. In 2010, Algeria began a five-year, $286 billion development program to update the country's infrastructure and provide jobs.

In 2009, economic growth remained above 9% even as oil prices moderated and growth in the construction sector cooled. In 2010, economic growth slowed to 3.7%, although the impact of the global financial crisis was less severe than in many other countries in the region. The current global economic slowdown presents some challenges for the Azerbaijani economy as oil prices remain below their mid-2008 highs, highlighting Azerbaijan's reliance on energy exports and lackluster attempts to diversify its economy. Azerbaijan's oil production increased dramatically in 1997, when Azerbaijan signed the first production-sharing arrangement (PSA) with the Azerbaijan International Operating Company. Oil exports through the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline remain the main economic driver while efforts to boost Azerbaijan's gas production are underway. However, Azerbaijan has made only limited progress on instituting market-based economic reforms. Pervasive public and private sector corruption and structural economic inefficiencies remain a drag on long-term growth, particularly in non-energy sectors. Several other obstacles impede Azerbaijan's economic progress: the need for stepped up foreign investment in the non-energy sector and the continuing conflict with Armenia over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Trade with Russia and the other former Soviet republics is declining in importance, while trade is building with Turkey and the nations of Europe. Long-term prospects will depend on world oil prices, the location of new oil and gas pipelines in the region, and Azerbaijan's ability to manage its energy wealth to promote sustainable growth in non-energy sectors of the economy and spur employment.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":90790000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":54370000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":5,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":5.5,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":61.4,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":33.1,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":5874000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":38.3,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":12.1,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":49.6,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":0.9,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":11,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":6.1,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":17.5,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":36.5,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":17.3,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":14190000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":14640000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":4.6,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":5.1,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":2,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":20.03,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":7340000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":11640000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":8135000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Agriculture - products":"cotton, grain, rice, grapes, fruit, vegetables, tea, tobacco; cattle, pigs, sheep, goats","Industries":"petroleum and natural gas, petroleum products, oilfield equipment; steel, iron ore; cement; chemicals and petrochemicals; textiles","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":3.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":18600000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":18000000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":786000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":548000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":1010999.9999999999,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":136000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":528900,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":2848,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":7000000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":23000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":10120000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":5564000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":849500000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":15960000000},"Exports":{"usd":28070000000},"Exports - commodities":"oil and gas 90%, machinery, cotton, foodstuffs","Exports - partners":"Italy 20.69%, India 10.67%, US 9.24%, France 8.15%, Germany 7.62%, Indonesia 6.63%, Canada 5.13% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":7035000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery and equipment, oil products, foodstuffs, metals, chemicals","Imports - partners":"Turkey 18.69%, Russia 16.98%, Germany 7.87%, Ukraine 7.3%, China 6.18%, UK 5.73% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":6330000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":3221000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":8918000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":6058000000},"Exchange rates":"Azerbaijani manats (AZN) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"al","name":"Albania","region":"Europe","background":"Albania declared its independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1912, but was conquered by Italy in 1939.

In the early 1990s, Albania ended 46 years of xenophobic Communist rule and established a multiparty democracy. The transition has proven challenging as successive governments have tried to deal with high unemployment, widespread corruption, a dilapidated physical infrastructure, powerful organized crime networks, and combative political opponents. Albania has made progress in its democratic development since first holding multiparty elections in 1991, but deficiencies remain. International observers judged elections to be largely free and fair since the restoration of political stability following the collapse of pyramid schemes in 1997; however, there have been claims of electoral fraud in every one of Albania's post-communist elections. The 2009 general elections resulted in no single party gaining a majority of the 140 seats in Parliament, and the Movement for Socialist Integration (LSI) and the Democratic Party (DP) combined to form a coalition government, the first such in Albania's history. The Socialist Party (SP) has, in effect, boycotted Parliament since it convened in September 2009 and has called for investigations into alleged electoral fraud in the June 2009 elections. Albania joined NATO in April 2009 and is a potential candidate for EU accession.

Macroeconomic growth averaged around 6% between 2004-08, but declined to about 3% in 2009-10. Inflation is low and stable. The government has taken measures to curb violent crime, and recently adopted a fiscal reform package aimed at reducing the large gray economy and attracting foreign investment. Remittances, a significant catalyst for economic growth have declined from 12-15% of GDP to 9% of GDP in 2009, mostly from Albanians residing in Greece and Italy; this helps offset the towering trade deficit. The agricultural sector, which accounts for almost half of employment but only about one-fifth of GDP, is limited primarily to small family operations and subsistence farming because of lack of modern equipment, unclear property rights, and the prevalence of small, inefficient plots of land. Energy shortages because of a reliance on hydropower, and antiquated and inadequate infrastructure contribute to Albania's poor business environment and lack of success in attracting new foreign investment needed to expand the country's export base. FDI is among the lowest in the region, but the government has embarked on an ambitious program to improve the business climate through fiscal and legislative reforms. The completion of a new thermal power plant near Vlore has helped diversify generation capacity, and plans to upgrade transmission lines between Albania and Montenegro and Kosovo would help relieve the energy shortages. Also, with help from EU funds, the government is taking steps to improve the poor national road and rail network, a long-standing barrier to sustained economic growth.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":23860000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":11770000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":3.5,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":18.9,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":23.5,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":57.6,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":1060000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":47.8,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":23,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":29.2,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":13.5,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":12.5,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":3.2,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":25.9,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":26.7,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":27.7,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":3205000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":3571000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":59.3,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":3.6,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":5,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":12.46,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":2566000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":9245000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":7701000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Agriculture - products":"wheat, corn, potatoes, vegetables, fruits, sugar beets, grapes; meat, dairy products","Industries":"food processing, textiles and clothing; lumber, oil, cement, chemicals, mining, basic metals, hydropower","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":5201000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":6593000000,"unit":"kWh"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":1884000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":5400,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":36000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":748.9,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":24080,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":199100000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":30000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":30000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":849500000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-1.245 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":1550000000},"Exports - commodities":"textiles and footwear; asphalt, metals and metallic ores, crude oil; vegetables, fruits, tobacco","Exports - partners":"Italy 50.8%, Kosovo 6.2%, Turkey 5.9%, Greece 5.4%, China 5.5% (2010 est.)","Imports":{"usd":4590000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery and equipment, foodstuffs, textiles, chemicals","Imports - partners":"Italy 28%, Greece 13%, China 6.3%, Turkey 5.6%, Germany 5.6% (2010 est.)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":1992000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":2810000000},"Exchange rates":"leke (ALL) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"am","name":"Armenia","region":"Middle East","background":"Armenia prides itself on being the first nation to formally adopt Christianity (early 4th century).

The eastern area of Armenia was ceded by the Ottomans to Russia in 1828; this portion declared its independence in 1918, but was conquered by the Soviet Red Army in 1920. Armenian leaders remain preoccupied by the long conflict with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh, a primarily Armenian-populated region, assigned to Soviet Azerbaijan in the 1920s by Moscow. Armenia and Azerbaijan began fighting over the area in 1988; the struggle escalated after both countries attained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. By May 1994, when a cease-fire took hold, ethnic Armenian forces held not only Nagorno-Karabakh but also a significant portion of Azerbaijan proper. The economies of both sides have been hurt by their inability to make substantial progress toward a peaceful resolution. Turkey closed the common border with Armenia in 1994 because of the Armenian separatists' control of Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding areas, further hampering Armenian economic growth. In 2009, senior Armenian leaders began pursuing rapprochement with Turkey, aiming to secure an opening of the border; this process is currently dormant.","geo":{"Location":"Southwestern Asia, between Turkey (to the west) and Azerbaijan","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":40,"min":0},"E":{"deg":45,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total:":{"quantity":29743,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world:":"","land:":{"quantity":28203,"unit":"sq km"},"water:":{"quantity":1540,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than Maryland","Land boundaries":{"total:":{"quantity":1254,"unit":"km"},"border countries:":"Azerbaijan-proper 566 km, Azerbaijan-Naxcivan exclave 221 km, Georgia 164 km, Iran 35 km, Turkey 268 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":"none (landlocked)","Climate":"highland continental, hot summers, cold winters","Terrain":"Armenian Highland with mountains;

Sharp declines in the construction sector and workers' remittances, particularly from Russia, were the main reasons for the downturn. The economy began to recover in 2010 with nearly 5% growth. Under the old Soviet central planning system, Armenia developed a modern industrial sector, supplying machine tools, textiles, and other manufactured goods to sister republics, in exchange for raw materials and energy. Armenia has since switched to small-scale agriculture and away from the large agroindustrial complexes of the Soviet era. Armenia has managed to reduce poverty, slash inflation, stabilize its currency, and privatize most small- and medium-sized enterprises. Since the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, Armenia had made progress in implementing some economic reforms, including privatization, price reforms, and prudent fiscal policies, but geographic isolation, a narrow export base, and pervasive monopolies in important business sectors have made Armenia particularly vulnerable to the sharp deterioration in the global economy and the economic downturn in Russia. The conflict with Azerbaijan over the ethnic Armenian-dominated region of Nagorno-Karabakh contributed to a severe economic decline in the early 1990s and Armenia's borders with Turkey remain closed. Armenia is particularly dependent on Russian commercial and governmental support and most key Armenian infrastructure is Russian-owned and/or managed, especially in the energy sector. The electricity distribution system was privatized in 2002 and bought by Russia's RAO-UES in 2005. Construction of a pipeline to deliver natural gas from Iran to Armenia was completed in December 2008, and gas deliveries are slated to expand due to the April 2010 completion of the Yerevan Thermal Power Plant. Armenia has some mineral deposits (copper, gold, bauxite). Pig iron, unwrought copper, and other nonferrous metals are Armenia's highest valued exports. Armenia's severe trade imbalance has been offset somewhat by international aid, remittances from Armenians working abroad, and foreign direct investment. Armenia joined the WTO in January 2003. The government made some improvements in tax and customs administration in recent years, but anti-corruption measures have been ineffective and the current economic downturn has led to a sharp drop in tax revenue and forced the government to accept large loan packages from Russia, the IMF, and other international financial institutions. Armenia will need to pursue additional economic reforms in order to regain economic growth and improve economic competitiveness and employment opportunities, especially given its economic isolation from two of its nearest neighbors, Turkey and Azerbaijan.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":16860000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":9389000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":2.6,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":22,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":46.6,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":31.4,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":1481000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":46.2,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":15.6,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":38.2,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":7.1,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":26.5,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":1.6,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":41.3,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":37,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":33.3,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":2063000000.0000002},"expenditures:":{"usd":2607000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":6.9,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"Central bank discount rate":"NA% (31 December 2009)","country comparison to the world:":""},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":18.76,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":1131000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":3507000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":1821000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":140500000},"Agriculture - products":"fruit (especially grapes), vegetables; livestock","Industries":"diamond-processing, metal-cutting machine tools, forging-pressing machines, electric motors, tires, knitted wear, hosiery, shoes, silk fabric, chemicals, trucks, instruments, microelectronics, jewelry manufacturing, software development, food processing, brandy","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":8,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":5584000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":4776000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":"451.3 million kWh; note - exports an unknown quantity to Georgia; includes exports to Nagorno-Karabakh region in Azerbaijan (2007 est.)","Electricity - imports":"418.7 million kWh; note - imports an unknown quantity from Iran (2007 est.)","Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":49000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":45200,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":1930000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":1930000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-1.138 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":846000000},"Exports - commodities":"pig iron, unwrought copper, nonferrous metals, diamonds, mineral products, foodstuffs, energy","Exports - partners":"Germany 16.47%, Russia 15.45%, US 9.64%, Bulgaria 8.6%, Georgia 7.57%, Netherlands 7.48%, Belgium 6.71%, Canada 4.91% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":2988000000},"Imports - commodities":"natural gas, petroleum, tobacco products, foodstuffs, diamonds","Imports - partners":"Russia 24.02%, China 8.72%, Ukraine 6.15%, Turkey 5.39%, Germany 5.36%, Iran 4.07% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":2247000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":5227000000},"Exchange rates":"drams (AMD) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"an","name":"Andorra","region":"Europe","background":"For 715 years, from 1278 to 1993, Andorrans lived under a unique co-principality, ruled by French and Spanish leaders (from 1607 onward, the French chief of state and the Spanish bishop of Seu d'Urgell).

Angola became a member of OPEC in late 2006 and in late 2007 was assigned a production quota of 1.9 million barrels a day (bbl/day), somewhat less than the 2-2.5 million bbl/day Angola's government had wanted. Oil production and its supporting activities contribute about 85% of GDP. Diamond exports contribute an additional 5%. Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for most of the people, but half of the country's food is still imported. Increased oil production supported growth averaging more than 15% per year from 2004 to 2008. A postwar reconstruction boom and resettlement of displaced persons has led to high rates of growth in construction and agriculture as well. Much of the country's infrastructure is still damaged or undeveloped from the 27-year-long civil war. Land mines left from the war still mar the countryside, even though peace was established after the death of rebel leader Jonas SAVIMBI in February 2002. Since 2005, the government has used billions of dollars in credit lines from China, Brazil, Portugal, Germany, Spain, and the EU to rebuild Angola's public infrastructure. The global recession temporarily stalled economic growth. Lower prices for oil and diamonds during the global recession led to a contraction in GDP in 2009, and many construction projects stopped because Luanda accrued $9 billion in arrears to foreign construction companies when government revenue fell in 2008 and 2009. Angola abandoned its currency peg in 2009, and in November 2009 signed onto an IMF Stand-By Arrangement loan of $1.4 billion to rebuild international reserves. Although consumer inflation declined from 325% in 2000 to under 14% in 2010, Luanda has been unable to reduce inflation below 10%. The Angolan kwanza depreciated again in mid 2010, which, along with higher oil prices, should boost economic growth in all sectors.

Although one of the world's wealthiest countries 100 years ago, Argentina suffered during most of the 20th century from recurring economic crises, persistent fiscal and current account deficits, high inflation, mounting external debt, and capital flight. A severe depression, growing public and external indebtedness, and a bank run culminated in 2001 in the most serious economic, social, and political crisis in the country's turbulent history. Interim President Adolfo RODRIGUEZ SAA declared a default - the largest in history - on the government's foreign debt in December of that year, and abruptly resigned only a few days after taking office. His successor, Eduardo DUHALDE, announced an end to the peso's decade-long 1-to-1 peg to the US dollar in early 2002. The economy bottomed out that year, with real GDP 18% smaller than in 1998 and almost 60% of Argentines under the poverty line. Real GDP rebounded to grow by an average 8.5% annually over the subsequent six years, taking advantage of previously idled industrial capacity and labor, an audacious debt restructuring and reduced debt burden, excellent international financial conditions, and expansionary monetary and fiscal policies. Inflation also increased, however, during the administration of President Nestor KIRCHNER, which responded with price restraints on businesses, as well as export taxes and restraints, and beginning in early 2007, with understating inflation data. Cristina FERNANDEZ DE KIRCHNER succeeded her husband as President in late 2007, and the rapid economic growth of previous years began to slow sharply the following year as government policies held back exports and the world economy fell into recession. The economy has rebounded strongly from the 2009 recession, but the government's continued reliance on expansionary fiscal and monetary policies risks exacerbating already high inflation.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":596000000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":370300000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":7.5,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":8.5,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":31.6,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":59.8,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":{"Labor force":16620000.000000002,"country comparison to the world:":""},"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":5,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":23,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":72,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":7.9,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":30,"unit":"%"}},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":1.7,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":29.5,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":"41.4 3rd quarter, 2010","Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":22,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":87630000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":86850000000}},"Public debt":{"Public debt":{"quantity":50.3,"unit":"% of GDP"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":22,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Central bank discount rate":"NA%","Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":11.3,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":40350000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":112900000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":113900000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":48930000000},"Agriculture - products":"sunflower seeds, lemons, soybeans, grapes, corn, tobacco, peanuts, tea, wheat; livestock","Industries":"food processing, motor vehicles, consumer durables, textiles, chemicals and petrochemicals, printing, metallurgy, steel","Industrial production growth rate":{"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":8.9,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":109500000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":99210000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":2628000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":10280000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":796300,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":622000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":314400,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":52290,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":2386000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":41360000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":43140000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":890000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":2660000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":398400000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":6976000000},"Exports":{"usd":68500000000},"Exports - commodities":"soybeans and derivatives, petroleum and gas, vehicles, corn, wheat","Exports - partners":"Brazil 18.78%, China 9.26%, Chile 7.11%, US 6.38% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":56440000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery, motor vehicles, petroleum and natural gas, organic chemicals, plastics","Imports - partners":"Brazil 31.12%, US 13.69%, China 10.26%, Germany 4.69% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":53610000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":160900000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":86800000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":30160000000},"Exchange rates":"Argentine pesos (ARS) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"as","name":"Australia","region":"Australia-Oceania","background":"Aboriginal settlers arrived on the continent from Southeast Asia about 40,000 years before the first Europeans began exploration in the 17th century.

A series of major investments, such as the US$40 billion Gorgon Liquid Natural Gas project, will significantly expand the resources sector. Australia also has a large services sector and is a significant exporter of natural resources, energy, and food. Key tenets of Australia's trade policy include support for open trade and the successful culmination of the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations, particularly for agriculture and services. The Australian economy grew for 17 consecutive years before the global financial crisis. Subsequently, the Rudd government introduced a fiscal stimulus package worth over US$50 billion to offset the effect of the slowing world economy, while the Reserve Bank of Australia cut interest rates to historic lows. These policies - and continued demand for commodities, especially from China - helped the Australian economy rebound after just one quarter of negative growth. The economy grew by 1.2% during 2009 - the best performance in the OECD - and by 3.3% in 2010. Unemployment, originally expected to reach 8-10%, peaked at 5.7% in late 2009 and fell to 5.1% in 2010. As a result of an improved economy, the budget deficit is expected to peak below 4.2% of GDP and the government could return to budget surpluses as early as 2015. Australia was one of the first advanced economies to raise interest rates, with seven rate hikes between October 2009 and November 2010. The GILLARD government is focused on raising Australia's economic productivity to ensure the sustainability of growth, and continues to manage the symbiotic, but sometimes tense, economic relationship with China. Australia is engaged in the Trans-Pacific Partnership talks and ongoing free trade agreement negotiations with China, Japan, and Korea.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":882400000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":1236000000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":2.7,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":4,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":24.8,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":71.2,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":11620000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":3.6,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":21.1,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":75,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":5.1,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":2,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":25.4,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":30.5,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":27.4,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":396100000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":426500000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":22.4,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":2.9,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":4,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":6.02,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":347100000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":1134000000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":1731000000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":1258000000000},"Agriculture - products":"wheat, barley, sugarcane, fruits; cattle, sheep, poultry","Industries":"mining, industrial and transportation equipment, food processing, chemicals, steel","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":239900000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":222000000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":589200,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":946300,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":311900,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":716700,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":3318000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":42330000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":26590000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":22300000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":6560000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":3115000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-35.23 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":210700000000},"Exports - commodities":"coal, iron ore, gold, meat, wool, alumina, wheat, machinery and transport equipment","Exports - partners":"China 21.81%, Japan 19.19%, South Korea 7.88%, India 7.51%, US 4.95%, UK 4.37%, NZ 4.1% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":200400000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery and transport equipment, computers and office machines, telecommunication equipment and parts; crude oil and petroleum products","Imports - partners":"China 17.94%, US 11.26%, Japan 8.36%, Thailand 5.81%, Singapore 5.54%, Germany 5.3% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":38620000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":1169000000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":329100000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":245900000000},"Exchange rates":"Australian dollars (AUD) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"at","name":"Ashmore and Cartier Islands","region":"Australia-Oceania","background":"These uninhabited islands came under Australian authority in 1931; formal administration began two years later.

Its economy features a large service sector, a sound industrial sector, and a small, but highly developed agricultural sector. Following several years of solid foreign demand for Austrian exports and record employment growth, the international financial crisis and global economic downturn in 2008 led to a sharp but brief recession. Austrian GDP contracted 3.9% in 2009 but saw positive growth of about 2% in 2010. Unemployment has not risen as steeply in Austria as elsewhere in Europe, partly because its government has subsidized reduced working hour schemes to allow companies to retain employees. Stabilization measures, stimulus spending, and an income tax reform pushed the budget deficit to 3.5% of GDP in 2009 and 4.7% in 2010, from only about 1.3% in 2008. The international financial crisis caused difficulties for Austria's largest banks whose extensive operations in central, eastern, and southeastern Europe faced large losses. The government provided bank support - including in some instances, nationalization - to prevent insolvency and possible contagion. In the medium-term all large Austrian banks will need additional capital. Even after the global economic outlook improves, Austria will need to continue restructuring, emphasize knowledge-based sectors of the economy, and encourage greater labor flexibility and labor participation to offset growing unemployment and Austria's aging population and low fertility rate.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":332000000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":376800000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":2,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":1.5,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":29.4,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":69.1,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":3700000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":5.5,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":27.5,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":67,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":4.5,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":6,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":4,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":22,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":26,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":21,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":172100000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":189400000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":70.4,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1.9,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":4.82,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":173400000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":402800000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":659200000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":118000000000},"Agriculture - products":"grains, potatoes, wine, fruit; dairy products, cattle, pigs, poultry; lumber","Industries":"construction, machinery, vehicles and parts, food, metals, chemicals, lumber and wood processing, paper and paperboard, communications equipment, tourism","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":7,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":68850000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":65670000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":18760000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":19540000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":21880,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":247700,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":50410,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":273000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":89000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":1580000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":8130000000.000001,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":3961000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":9460000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":24800000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":9900000000},"Exports":{"usd":157400000000},"Exports - commodities":"machinery and equipment, motor vehicles and parts, paper and paperboard, metal goods, chemicals, iron and steel, textiles, foodstuffs","Exports - partners":"Germany 30.96%, Italy 8.17%, Switzerland 4.99%, US 3.99% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":156000000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery and equipment, motor vehicles, chemicals, metal goods, oil and oil products; foodstuffs","Imports - partners":"Germany 45.07%, Switzerland 6.76%, Italy 6.66%, Netherlands 4.03% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":21890000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":755000000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":154000000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":154100000000},"Exchange rates":"euros (EUR) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"av","name":"Anguilla","region":"Central America and Caribbean","background":"Colonized by English settlers from Saint Kitts in 1650, Anguilla was administered by Great Britain until the early 19th century, when the island - against the wishes of the inhabitants - was incorporated into a single British dependency along with Saint Kitts and Nevis.

A number of countries have set up a range of year-round and seasonal stations, camps, and refuges to support scientific research in Antarctica. Seven have made territorial claims, but not all countries recognize these claims.

In order to secure these holdings, it entered into a series of treaties with the UK during the 19th century that made Bahrain a British protectorate. The archipelago attained its independence in 1971. Facing declining oil reserves, Bahrain has turned to petroleum processing and refining and has transformed itself into an international banking center. Bahrain's small size and central location among Persian Gulf countries require it to play a delicate balancing act in foreign affairs among its larger neighbors. In addition, the Sunni-led government has struggled to manage relations with its approximately 70% Shia-majority population. During the mid-to-late 1990s Shia activists mounted a low-intensity uprising to demand that the Sunni-led government stop systemic economic, social, and political discrimination against Shia Bahrainis. King HAMAD bin Isa Al-Khalifa, after succeeding his late father in 1999, pushed economic and political reforms in part to improve relations with the Shia community. After boycotting the country's first round of democratic elections under the newly-promulgated constitution in 2002, Shia political societies participated in 2006 and 2010 in legislative and municipal elections and Wafiq, the largest Shia political society, won the largest bloc of seats in the elected lower-house of the legislature both times.

Highly developed communication and transport facilities make Bahrain home to numerous multinational firms with business in the Gulf. As part of its diversification plans, Bahrain implemented a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the US in August 2006, the first FTA between the US and a Gulf state. Bahrain's economy, however, continues to depend heavily on oil. Petroleum production and refining account for more than 60% of Bahrain's export receipts, 70% of government revenues, and 11% of GDP (exclusive of allied industries). Other major economic activities are production of aluminum - Bahrain's second biggest export after oil - finance, and construction. Bahrain competes with Malaysia as a worldwide center for Islamic banking and continues to seek new natural gas supplies as feedstock to support its expanding petrochemical and aluminum industries. Unemployment, especially among the young, is a long-term economic problem Bahrain struggles to address. In 2009, to help lower unemployment among Bahraini nationals, Bahrain reduced sponsorship for expatriate workers, increasing the costs of employing foreign labor. The global financial crisis caused funding for many non-oil projects to dry up and resulted in slower economic growth for Bahrain. Other challenges facing Bahrain include the slow growth of government debt as a result of a large subsidy program, the financing of large government projects, and debt restructuring, such as the bailout of state-owned Gulf Air.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":29710000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":22660000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":4.1,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":0.5,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":56.6,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":42.9,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":{"Labor force":611000,"country comparison to the world:":""},"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":1,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":79,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":20,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":15,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":"NA%","highest 10%:":"NA%"},"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":26.6,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":5933000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":5948000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":59.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":3.3,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":"NA% (31 December 2009 est.)","Stock of narrow money":{"usd":6372000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":21020000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":18460000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":16930000000},"Agriculture - products":"fruit, vegetables; poultry, dairy products; shrimp, fish","Industries":"petroleum processing and refining, aluminum smelting, iron pelletization, fertilizers, Islamic and offshore banking, insurance, ship repairing, tourism","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":1.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":10250000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":10100000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":48560,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":39000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":238300,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":228400,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":124600000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":12640000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":12640000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":92030000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":589000000},"Exports":{"usd":15130000000},"Exports - commodities":"petroleum and petroleum products, aluminum, textiles","Exports - partners":"India 4.2%, Saudi Arabia 2.78% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":12140000000},"Imports - commodities":"crude oil, machinery, chemicals","Imports - partners":"Saudi Arabia 22.91%, France 9.76%, US 7.95%, China 6.4%, South Korea 5.26%, Japan 5.19%, Germany 5.01%, UK 4.34% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":3766000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":14680000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":15770000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":8398999999.999999},"Exchange rates":"Bahraini dinars (BHD) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"bb","name":"Barbados","region":"Central America and Caribbean","background":"The island was uninhabited when first settled by the British in 1627.

The public debt-to-GDP ratio rose to over 100% in 2009, largely because a sharp slowdown in tourism and financial services led to a wide budget deficit.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":6227000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":3963000000},"GDP - real growth rate":"-0.5% (2010 est.)","GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":6,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":16,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":78,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":175000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":10,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":15,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":75,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":10.7,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":"NA%","highest 10%:":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":847000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":886000000}},"Public debt":"NA% of GDP (2009)","Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":5.5,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":7,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":9.25,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":1793000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":4563000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":4554000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA (31 December 2009)","Agriculture - products":"sugarcane, vegetables, cotton","Industries":"tourism, sugar, light manufacturing, component assembly for export","Industrial production growth rate":"-3.2% (2000 est.)","Electricity - production":{"quantity":1002999999.9999999,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":939900000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":765,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":9000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":1750,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":10390,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":1790000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":29170000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":29170000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":113300000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-254 million (2007 est.)","Exports":{"usd":385000000},"Exports - commodities":"manufactures, sugar and molasses, rum, other foods and beverages, chemicals, electrical components","Exports - partners":"Trinidad and Tobago 17.48%, Jamaica 15.63%, US 8.93%, Saint Lucia 8.13%, UK 5.36%, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines 5.04%, Antigua and Barbuda 4.12% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":1586000000},"Imports - commodities":"consumer goods, machinery, foodstuffs, construction materials, chemicals, fuel, electrical components","Imports - partners":"Trinidad and Tobago 28.52%, US 27.96%, Colombia 7.13%, China 4.76%, UK 4.39% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":620000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":668000000},"Exchange rates":"Barbadian dollars (BBD) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"bc","name":"Botswana","region":"Africa","background":"Formerly the British protectorate of Bechuanaland, Botswana adopted its new name upon independence in 1966.

Two major investment services rank Botswana as the best credit risk in Africa. Diamond mining has fueled much of the expansion and currently accounts for more than one-third of GDP, 70-80% of export earnings, and about half of the government's revenues. Botswana's heavy reliance on a single luxury export was a critical factor in the sharp economic contraction of 2009. Tourism, financial services, subsistence farming, and cattle raising are other key sectors. Although unemployment was 7.5% in 2007 according to official reports, unofficial estimates place it closer to 40%.

In 2010 Belgian GDP grew by 2.1%, the unemployment rate rose slightly, and the government reduced the budget deficit, which had worsened in 2008 and 2009 because of large-scale bail-outs in the financial sector. Belgium's budget deficit decreased from 6% of GDP to 4.8% in 2010, while public debt was just under 100% of GDP. Belgian banks were severely affected by the international financial crisis with three major banks receiving capital injections from the government. An ageing population and rising social expenditures are mid- to long-term challenges to public finances.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":394300000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":465700000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":2,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":0.7,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":22.1,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":77.2,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":5020000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":2,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":25,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":73,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":8.5,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":15.2,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":3.4,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":28.4,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":28,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":20.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":220600000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":242600000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":98.6,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":2.3,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":1.75,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":6.15,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":172900000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":539400000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":801100000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":261399999999.99997},"Agriculture - products":"sugar beets, fresh vegetables, fruits, grain, tobacco; beef, veal, pork, milk","Industries":"engineering and metal products, motor vehicle assembly, transportation equipment, scientific instruments, processed food and beverages, chemicals, basic metals, textiles, glass, petroleum","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":4,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":82170000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":84880000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":6561000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":17160000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":11220,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":608200,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":433700,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":1120000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":16870000000.000002,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":16780000000.000002,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-1.129 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":279200000000},"Exports - commodities":"machinery and equipment, chemicals, finished diamonds, metals and metal products, foodstuffs","Exports - partners":"Germany 19.58%, France 17.71%, Netherlands 11.84%, UK 7.21%, US 5.37%, Italy 4.77% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":281700000000},"Imports - commodities":"raw materials, machinery and equipment, chemicals, raw diamonds, pharmaceuticals, foodstuffs, transportation equipment, oil products","Imports - partners":"Netherlands 17.93%, Germany 17.14%, France 11.69%, Ireland 6.26%, US 5.74%, UK 5.07%, China 4.09% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":"$NA (31 December 2010 est.)","Debt - external":{"usd":1241000000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":741700000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":632800000000},"Exchange rates":"euros (EUR) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"bf","name":"Bahamas, The","region":"Central America and Caribbean","background":"Lucayan Indians inhabited the islands when Christopher COLUMBUS first set foot in the New World on San Salvador in 1492.

Tourism together with tourism-driven construction and manufacturing accounts for approximately 60% of GDP and directly or indirectly employs half of the archipelago's labor force. Prior to 2006, a steady growth in tourism receipts and a boom in construction of new hotels, resorts, and residences led to solid GDP growth but since then tourism receipts have begun to drop off. The global recession in 2009 took a sizeable toll on the Bahamas, resulting in a contraction in GDP and a widening budget deficit. The decline continued in 2010 as tourism from the US and sector investment lagged. Financial services constitute the second-most important sector of the Bahamian economy and, when combined with business services, account for about 36% of GDP. However, the financial sector currently is smaller than it has been in the past because of the enactment of new and stricter financial regulations in 2000 that caused many international businesses to relocate elsewhere. Manufacturing and agriculture combined contribute approximately a tenth of GDP and show little growth, despite government incentives aimed at those sectors. Overall growth prospects in the short run rest heavily on the fortunes of the tourism sector.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":8921000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":7538000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":0.5,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":1.2,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":14.7,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":84.1,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":184000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":5,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":5,"unit":"%"},"tourism:":{"quantity":50,"unit":"%"},"other services:":{"quantity":40,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":7.6,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":9.3,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":"NA%","highest 10%:":{"quantity":27,"unit":"%"}},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":1030000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":1030000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":2.4,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":5.25,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":5.5,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":1284000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":5991000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":7993000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Agriculture - products":"citrus, vegetables; poultry","Industries":"tourism, banking, cement, oil transshipment, salt, rum, aragonite, pharmaceuticals, spiral-welded steel pipe","Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Electricity - production":{"quantity":2045000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":1902000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":36000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":"transshipments of 41,570 bbl/day (2007 est.)","Oil - imports":{"quantity":20560,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-283.2 million (2009 est.)","Exports":{"usd":674000000},"Exports - commodities":"mineral products and salt, animal products, rum, chemicals, fruit and vegetables","Exports - partners":"US 35.99%, Singapore 18.64%, Poland 12.1%, Germany 6.24% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":2401000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery and transport equipment, manufactures, chemicals, mineral fuels; food and live animals","Imports - partners":"US 27.23%, South Korea 20.08%, Japan 14.55%, Singapore 5.89%, China 4.75%, Venezuela 4.26%, Italy 4.12% (2009)","Debt - external":{"usd":342600000},"Exchange rates":"Bahamian dollars (BSD) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"bg","name":"Bangladesh","region":"South Asia","background":"Europeans began to set up trading posts in the area of Bangladesh in the 16th century; eventually the British came to dominate the region and it became part of British India.

The government's expansionary monetary and fiscal policies, initiated in September 1998, led to GDP growth averaging nearly 4% in 1999-2007. Oil discoveries in 2006 bolstered this growth. Exploration efforts have continued and production has increased a small amount. In February 2007, the government restructured nearly all of its public external commercial debt, which helped reduce interest payments and relieved some of the country's liquidity concerns. Growth slipped to 0% in 2009 and 1.5% in 2010 as a result of the global slowdown, natural disasters, and the drop in the price of oil. With weak economic growth and a large public debt burden, fiscal spending is likely to be tight. A key government objective remains the reduction of poverty and inequality with the help of international donors. Although Belize has the second highest per capita income in Central America, the average income figure masks a huge income disparity between rich and poor. The 2010 Poverty Assessment shows that more than 4 out of 10 people live in poverty. The sizable trade deficit and heavy foreign debt burden continue to be major concerns.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":2651000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":1396000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":2,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":29,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":16.9,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":54.1,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":{"Labor force":120500,"country comparison to the world:":""},"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":10.2,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":18.1,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":71.7,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":13.1,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":43,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":"NA%","highest 10%:":"NA%"},"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":26.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":370500000},"expenditures:":{"usd":418000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":80,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":4.1,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":12,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":14.08,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":389500000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":1351000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":1291000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Agriculture - products":"bananas, cacao, citrus, sugar; fish, cultured shrimp; lumber","Industries":"garment production, food processing, tourism, construction, oil","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":1.4,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":213500000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":198500000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":248400000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":3990,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":7000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":2260,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":7204,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":6700000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-151 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":404000000},"Exports - commodities":"sugar, bananas, citrus, clothing, fish products, molasses, wood, crude oil","Exports - partners":"US 30.7%, UK 29.77%, Nigeria 4.9%, Cote d'Ivoire 4.45% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":740000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery and transport equipment, manufactured goods; fuels, chemicals, pharmaceuticals; food, beverages, tobacco","Imports - partners":"US 33.65%, Mexico 14.17%, Cuba 8.51%, Guatemala 6.75%, Spain 6.07%, China 4.12% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":219000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":1010000000},"Exchange rates":"Belizean dollars (BZD) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"bk","name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","region":"Europe","background":"Bosnia and Herzegovina's declaration of sovereignty in October 1991 was followed by a declaration of independence from the former Yugoslavia on 3 March 1992 after a referendum boycotted by ethnic Serbs. The Bosnian Serbs - supported by neighboring Serbia and Montenegro - responded with armed resistance aimed at partitioning the republic along ethnic lines and joining Serb-held areas to form a \"Greater Serbia.\" In March 1994, Bosniaks and Croats reduced the number of warring factions from three to two by signing an agreement creating a joint Bosniak/Croat Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. On 21 November 1995, in Dayton, Ohio, the warring parties initialed a peace agreement that brought to a halt three years of interethnic civil strife (the final agreement was signed in Paris on 14 December 1995). The Dayton Peace Accords retained Bosnia and Herzegovina's international boundaries and created a multi-ethnic and democratic government charged with conducting foreign, diplomatic, and fiscal policy. Also recognized was a second tier of government composed of two entities roughly equal in size: the Bosniak/Bosnian Croat Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Bosnian Serb-led Republika Srpska (RS). The Federation and RS governments were charged with overseeing most government functions. The Dayton Accords also established the Office of the High Representative (OHR) to oversee the implementation of the civilian aspects of the agreement. The Peace Implementation Council (PIC) at its conference in Bonn in 1997 also gave the High Representative the authority to impose legislation and remove officials, the so-called \"Bonn Powers.\" In 1995-96, a NATO-led international peacekeeping force (IFOR) of 60,000 troops served in Bosnia to implement and monitor the military aspects of the agreement. IFOR was succeeded by a smaller, NATO-led Stabilization Force (SFOR) whose mission was to deter renewed hostilities. European Union peacekeeping troops (EUFOR) replaced SFOR in December 2004; their mission is to maintain peace and stability throughout the country. EUFOR's mission changed from peacekeeping to civil policing in October 2007, with its presence reduced from nearly 7,000 to less than 2,500 troops. Troop strength at the end of 2010 stood at roughly 1,500. In January 2010, Bosnia and Herzegovina assumed a nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council for the 2010-11 term.","geo":{"Location":"Southeastern Europe, bordering the Adriatic Sea and Croatia","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":44,"min":0},"E":{"deg":18,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total:":{"quantity":51197,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world:":"","land:":{"quantity":51187,"unit":"sq km"},"water:":{"quantity":10,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than West Virginia","Land boundaries":{"total:":{"quantity":1538,"unit":"km"},"border countries:":"Croatia 932 km, Montenegro 249 km, Serbia 357 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":20,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":"no data available","Climate":"hot summers and cold winters;

With an uneasy peace in place, output recovered in 1996-99 at high percentage rates from a low base; but output growth slowed in 2000-02. Part of the lag in output was made up during 2003-08, when GDP growth exceeded 5% per year. However, the country experienced a decline in GDP of more than 3% in 2009 reflecting local effects of the global economic crisis. One of Bosnia's main economic challenges in 2010 has been to reduce spending on public sector wages and social benefits to meet the IMF's criteria for obtaining funding for budget shortfalls. Banking reform accelerated in 2001 as all the Communist-era payments bureaus were shut down; foreign banks, primarily from Austria and Italy, now control most of the banking sector. The konvertibilna marka (convertible mark or BAM) - the national currency introduced in 1998 - is pegged to the euro, and confidence in the currency and the banking sector has increased. Bosnia's private sector is growing, but foreign investment has dropped off sharply since 2007. Government spending, at roughly 50% of GDP, remains high because of redundant government offices at the state, entity and municipal level. Privatization of state enterprises has been slow, particularly in the Federation where political division between ethnically-based political parties makes agreement on economic policy more difficult. A sizeable current account deficit and high unemployment rate remain the two most serious macroeconomic problems. Successful implementation of a value-added tax in 2006 provided a predictable source of revenue for the government and helped rein in gray-market activity. National-level statistics have also improved over time but a large share of economic activity remains unofficial and unrecorded. Bosnia and Herzegovina became a full member of the Central European Free Trade Agreement in September 2007. Bosnia and Herzegovina's top economic priorities are: acceleration of integration into the EU; strengthening the fiscal system; public administration reform; World Trade Organization (WTO) membership; and securing economic growth by fostering a dynamic, competitive private sector. The country has received a substantial amount of foreign assistance and will need to demonstrate its ability to implement its economic reform agenda in order to advance its stated goal of EU accession. In 2009, Bosnia and Herzegovina undertook an International Monetary Fund (IMF) standby arrangement, necessitated by sharply increased social spending and a fiscal crisis exacerbated by the global economic downturn. The program aims to reduce recurrent government spending and to strengthen revenue collection.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":30330000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":16829999999.999998},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":0.8,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":6.5,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":28.4,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":65.1,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":2600000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":20.5,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":32.6,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":47,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":43.1,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":18.6,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":2.8,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":27.4,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":34.1,"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":7750000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":7820000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":39,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":3.1,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":7.93,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":4098000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":9307000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":10090000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Agriculture - products":"wheat, corn, fruits, vegetables; livestock","Industries":"steel, coal, iron ore, lead, zinc, manganese, bauxite, aluminum, vehicle assembly, textiles, tobacco products, wooden furniture, ammunition, domestic appliances, oil refining","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":1.6,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":14580000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":10800000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":3900000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":1200000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":"NA bbl/day (2008 est.)","Oil - consumption":"NA bbl/day (2009 est.)","Oil - exports":{"quantity":191.8,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":25990,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":390000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":390000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-1.175 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":4804000000},"Exports - commodities":"metals, clothing, wood products","Exports - partners":"Croatia 19.07%, Slovenia 18.58%, Italy 16.87%, Germany 13.38%, Austria 10.25% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":9220000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery and equipment, chemicals, fuels, foodstuffs","Imports - partners":"Croatia 22.17%, Germany 14.04%, Slovenia 13.45%, Italy 11.89%, Austria 6.61%, Hungary 5.74% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":4200000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":7996000000},"Exchange rates":"konvertibilna markas (BAM) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"bl","name":"Bolivia","region":"South America","background":"Bolivia, named after independence fighter Simon BOLIVAR, broke away from Spanish rule in 1825; much of its subsequent history has consisted of a series of nearly 200 coups and countercoups.

However, since taking office, his controversial strategies have exacerbated racial and economic tensions between the Amerindian populations of the Andean west and the non-indigenous communities of the eastern lowlands.

Following a disastrous economic crisis during the early 1980s, reforms spurred private investment, stimulated economic growth, and cut poverty rates in the 1990s. The period 2003-05 was characterized by political instability, racial tensions, and violent protests against plans - subsequently abandoned - to export Bolivia's newly discovered natural gas reserves to large northern hemisphere markets. In 2005, the government passed a controversial hydrocarbons law that imposed significantly higher royalties and required foreign firms then operating under risk-sharing contracts to surrender all production to the state energy company in exchange for a predetermined service fee. After higher prices for mining and hydrocarbons exports produced a fiscal surplus in 2008, the global recession in 2009 slowed growth. Nevertheless, Bolivia recorded the highest growth rate in South America that year. During 2010 an increase in world commodity prices resulted in the biggest trade surplus in history. However, a lack of foreign investment in the key sectors of mining and hydrocarbons and higher food prices pose challenges for the Bolivian economy.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":47880000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":19370000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":4.2,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":12,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":38,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":50,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":4186000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":40,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":17,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":43,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":6.5,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Population below poverty line":{"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":30.3,"unit":"%"}},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":0.5,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":44.1,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":58.2,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":20.1,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":10110000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":10000000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":39.7,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":7.2,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":5.75,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":5367000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":12160000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":7060000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":3915000000},"Agriculture - products":"soybeans, coffee, coca, cotton, corn, sugarcane, rice, potatoes; timber","Industries":"mining, smelting, petroleum, food and beverages, tobacco, handicrafts, clothing","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":4,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":6085000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":5814000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":43740,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":31070,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":5621,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":17330,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":465000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":14400000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":2410000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":11590000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":750400000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":690200000},"Exports":{"usd":6956000000},"Exports - commodities":"natural gas, soybeans and soy products, crude petroleum, zinc ore, tin","Exports - partners":"Brazil 41.38%, US 13.87%, Japan 5.62%, Colombia 5.32%, South Korea 4.7%, Peru 4.16% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":5366000000},"Imports - commodities":"petroleum products, plastics, paper, aircraft and aircraft parts, prepared foods, automobiles, insecticides, soybeans","Imports - partners":"Brazil 27.12%, Argentina 15.69%, US 12.77%, Chile 9.11%, Peru 6.85% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":9730000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":2864000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":7257000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":21000000},"Exchange rates":"bolivianos (BOB) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"bm","name":"Burma","region":"East & Southeast Asia","background":"Britain conquered Burma over a period of 62 years (1824-1886) and incorporated it into its Indian Empire. Burma was administered as a province of India until 1937 when it became a separate, self-governing colony; independence from the Commonwealth was attained in 1948. Gen. NE WIN dominated the government from 1962 to 1988, first as military ruler, then as self-appointed president, and later as political kingpin. In September 1988, the military deposed NE WIN and established a new ruling junta. Despite multiparty legislative elections in 1990 that resulted in the main opposition party - the National League for Democracy (NLD) - winning a landslide victory, the junta refused to hand over power. NLD leader and Nobel Peace Prize recipient AUNG SAN SUU KYI, who was under house arrest from 1989 to 1995 and 2000 to 2002, was imprisoned in May 2003 and subsequently transferred to house arrest. She was finally released in November 2010. After the ruling junta in August 2007 unexpectedly increased fuel prices, tens of thousands of Burmese marched in protest, led by prodemocracy activists and Buddhist monks. In late September 2007, the government brutally suppressed the protests, killing at least 13 people and arresting thousands for participating in the demonstrations. Since then, the regime has continued to raid homes and monasteries and arrest persons suspected of participating in the pro-democracy protests. Burma in early May 2008 was struck by Cyclone Nargis, which claimed over 138,000 dead and tens of thousands injured and homeless. Despite this tragedy, the junta proceeded with its May constitutional referendum, the first vote in Burma since 1990. Parliamentary elections held in November 2010, considered flawed by many in the international community, saw the junta's Union Solidarity and Development Party garnering over 75% of the seats. Parliament convened in January 2011 and selected former Prime Minister THEIN SEIN as president. The vast majority of national-level appointees named by THEIN SEIN are former or current military officers.","geo":{"Location":"Southeastern Asia, bordering the Andaman Sea and the Bay of Bengal, between Bangladesh and Thailand","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":22,"min":0},"E":{"deg":98,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total:":{"quantity":676578,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world:":"","land:":{"quantity":653508,"unit":"sq km"},"water:":{"quantity":23070,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than Texas","Land boundaries":{"total:":{"quantity":5876,"unit":"km"},"border countries:":"Bangladesh 193 km, China 2,185 km, India 1,463 km, Laos 235 km, Thailand 1,800 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":1930,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea:":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone:":{"quantity":24,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone:":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf:":"200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin"},"Climate":"tropical monsoon;

Despite Burma's emergence as a natural gas exporter, socio-economic conditions have deteriorated under the regime's mismanagement, leaving most of the public in poverty, while military leaders and their business cronies exploit the country's ample natural resources. The transfer of state assets, especially real estate, to cronies and military families in 2010 under the guise of a privatization policy further widened the gap between the economic elite and the public. The economy suffers from serious macroeconomic imbalances - including unpredictable inflation, fiscal deficits, multiple official exchange rates that overvalue the Burmese kyat, a distorted interest rate regime, unreliable statistics, and an inability to reconcile national accounts. Burma's poor investment climate hampers the inflow of foreign investment; in recent years, foreign investors have shied away from nearly every sector except for natural gas, power generation, timber, and mining. The exploitation of natural resources does not benefit the population at large. The business climate is widely perceived as opaque, corrupt, and highly inefficient. Over 60% of the FY 2009-10 budget was allocated to state owned enterprises - most operating at a deficit. The most productive sectors will continue to be in extractive industries - especially oil and gas, mining, and timber - with the latter two causing significant environmental degradation. Other areas, such as manufacturing, tourism and services, struggle in the face of inadequate infrastructure, unpredictable trade policies, neglected health and education systems, and endemic corruption. A major banking crisis in 2003 caused 20 private banks to close; private banks still operate under tight restrictions, limiting the private sector's access to credit. The United States, the European Union, and Canada have imposed financial and economic sanctions on Burma. US sanctions, prohibiting most financial transactions with Burmese entities, impose travel bans on senior Burmese military and civilian leaders and others connected to the ruling regime, and ban imports of Burmese products. These sanctions affected the country's fledgling garment industry, isolated the struggling banking sector, and raised the costs of doing business with Burmese companies, particularly firms tied to Burmese regime leaders. The global crisis of 2008-09 caused exports and domestic consumer demand to drop. Remittances from overseas Burmese workers - who had provided significant financial support for their families - slowed or dried up as jobs were lost and migrant workers returned home. Although the Burmese government has good economic relations with its neighbors, significant improvements in economic governance, the business climate, and the political situation are needed to promote serious foreign investment.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":76470000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":42950000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":5.3,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":43.2,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":20,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":36.8,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":31680000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":70,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":7,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":23,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":5.7,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":32.7,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":2.8,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":32.4,"unit":"%"}},"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":15.1,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":1369000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":2951000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":9.6,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":12,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":17,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":4907000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":7800000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":8552000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Agriculture - products":"rice, pulses, beans, sesame, groundnuts, sugarcane; hardwood; fish and fish products","Industries":"agricultural processing; wood and wood products; copper, tin, tungsten, iron; cement, construction materials; pharmaceuticals; fertilizer; oil and natural gas; garments, jade and gems","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":4.3,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":6286000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":4403000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":18880,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":42000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":2200,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":18250,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":50000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":12400000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":3850000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":8550000000.000001,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":283200000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":652000000},"Exports":{"Exports":{"usd":7841000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Exports - commodities":"natural gas, wood products, pulses, beans, fish, rice, clothing, jade and gems","Exports - partners":"Thailand 46.57%, India 12.99%, China 9.01%, Japan 5.65% (2009)","Imports":{"Imports":{"usd":4532000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Imports - commodities":"fabric, petroleum products, fertilizer, plastics, machinery, transport equipment; cement, construction materials, crude oil; food products, edible oil","Imports - partners":"China 33.1%, Thailand 26.28%, Singapore 15.18% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":3762000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":7145000000},"Exchange rates":"kyats (MMK) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"bn","name":"Benin","region":"Africa","background":"Present day Benin was the site of Dahomey, a prominent West African kingdom that rose in the 15th century.

Growth in real output had averaged about 4% before the global recession, but fell to 2.7% in 2009 and 3% in 2010. Inflation has subsided over the past several years. In order to raise growth, Benin plans to attract more foreign investment, place more emphasis on tourism, facilitate the development of new food processing systems and agricultural products, and encourage new information and communication technology. Specific projects to improve the business climate by reforms to the land tenure system, the commercial justice system, and the financial sector were included in Benin's $307 million Millennium Challenge Account grant signed in February 2006. The 2001 privatization policy continues in telecommunications, water, electricity, and agriculture. As result of these reforms, Benin has become the most competitive country in the West African Economic and Monetary Union, according to the World Economic Forum. The Paris Club and bilateral creditors have eased the external debt situation, with Benin benefiting from a G-8 debt reduction announced in July 2005, while pressing for more rapid structural reforms. An insufficient electrical supply continues to adversely affect Benin's economic growth though the government recently has taken steps to increase domestic power production.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":13990000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":6649000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":2.5,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":33.2,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":14.5,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":52.3,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":3662000,"Unemployment rate":"NA%","Population below poverty line":{"quantity":37.4,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":3.1,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":29,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":36.5,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":18.5,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":1348000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":1731000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1.6,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":4.25,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":"NA%","Stock of narrow money":{"usd":1551000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":2424000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":1222000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Agriculture - products":"cotton, corn, cassava (tapioca), yams, beans, palm oil, peanuts, cashews; livestock","Industries":"textiles, food processing, construction materials, cement","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":124000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":597000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":588000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":23000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":8770,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":28900,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":8000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":1133000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-582 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":1125000000},"Exports - commodities":"cotton, cashews, shea butter, textiles, palm products, seafood","Exports - partners":"India 19.72%, China 13.18%, Niger 6.94%, Nigeria 6.56%, Indonesia 5.73%, Togo 5.63%, Namibia 4.17% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":1812000000},"Imports - commodities":"foodstuffs, capital goods, petroleum products","Imports - partners":"China 35.62%, US 7.51%, France 7.38%, Thailand 6.71%, Malaysia 6.13%, Netherlands 4.83%, Belgium 4.02% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":1254000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":2894000000},"Exchange rates":"Communaute Financiere Africaine francs (XOF) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"bo","name":"Belarus","region":"Europe","background":"After seven decades as a constituent republic of the USSR, Belarus attained its independence in 1991.

Since 2005, the government has re-nationalized a number of private companies. In addition, businesses have been subjected to pressure by central and local governments, including arbitrary changes in regulations, numerous rigorous inspections, retroactive application of new business regulations, and arrests of \"disruptive\" businessmen and factory owners. Continued state control over economic operations hampers market entry for businesses, both domestic and foreign. Government statistics indicate GDP growth was strong, surpassing 10% in 2008, despite the roadblocks of a tough, centrally directed economy with a high rate of inflation and a low rate of unemployment. However, the global crisis pushed the country into recession in 2009, and GDP grew only 0.2% for the year. Slumping foreign demand hit the industrial sector hard. Minsk has depended on a standby-agreement with the IMF to assist with balance of payments shortfalls. In line with IMF conditions, in 2009, Belarus devalued the ruble more than 40% and tightened some fiscal and monetary policies. On 1 January 2010, Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus launched a customs union, with unified trade regulations and customs codes still under negotiation. In late January, Russia and Belarus amended their 2007 oil supply agreement. The new terms raised prices for above quota purchases, increasing Belarus' current account deficit. GDP grew 4.8% in 2010, in part, on the strength of renewed export growth. In December 2010, Belarus, Russia and Kazakhstan signed an agreement to form a Common Economic Space and Russia removed all Belarusian oil duties.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":131199999999.99998},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":54710000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":7.6,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":9,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":42.9,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":48.1,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":5000000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":14,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":34.7,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":51.3,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":1,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":27.1,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":3.6,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":22,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":27.9,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":36,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":23270000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":24320000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":7,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":13.5,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":11.68,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":4747000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":13620000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":19990000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Agriculture - products":"grain, potatoes, vegetables, sugar beets, flax; beef, milk","Industries":"metal-cutting machine tools, tractors, trucks, earthmovers, motorcycles, televisions, synthetic fibers, fertilizer, textiles, radios, refrigerators","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":10.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":29920000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":30540000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":5062000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":9406000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":31400,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":173000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":303900,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":444800,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":198000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":152000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":17000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":17600000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":2832000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-5.062 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":24490000000},"Exports - commodities":"machinery and equipment, mineral products, chemicals, metals, textiles, foodstuffs","Exports - partners":"Russia 33.6%, Netherlands 13.78%, Ukraine 8.68%, Latvia 6.32%, Poland 4.19%, Germany 4.17% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":29790000000},"Imports - commodities":"mineral products, machinery and equipment, chemicals, foodstuffs, metals","Imports - partners":"Russia 56.42%, Germany 8.31%, Ukraine 4.79%, China 4.04% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":5755000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":24800000000},"Exchange rates":"Belarusian rubles (BYB/BYR) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"bp","name":"Solomon Islands","region":"Australia-Oceania","background":"The UK established a protectorate over the Solomon Islands in the 1890s.

After record growth in 2007 and 2008, the onset of the global financial crisis hit Brazil in September 2008.

However, Brazil was one of the first emerging markets to begin a recovery. Consumer and investor confidence revived and GDP growth returned to positive in 2010, boosted by an export recovery. Brazil's strong growth and high interest rates make it an attractive destination for foreign investors. Large capital inflows over the past year have contributed to the rapid appreciation of its currency and led the government to raise taxes on some foreign investments.

The economy is closely aligned with India's through strong trade and monetary links and dependence on India's financial assistance. The industrial sector is technologically backward, with most production of the cottage industry type. Most development projects, such as road construction, rely on Indian migrant labor. Model education, social, and environment programs are underway with support from multilateral development organizations. Each economic program takes into account the government's desire to protect the country's environment and cultural traditions. For example, the government, in its cautious expansion of the tourist sector, encourages visits by upscale, environmentally conscientious tourists. Complicated controls and uncertain policies in areas such as industrial licensing, trade, labor, and finance continue to hamper foreign investment. Hydropower exports to India have boosted Bhutan's overall growth.

Communist domination ended in 1990, when Bulgaria held its first multiparty election since World War II and began the contentious process of moving toward political democracy and a market economy while combating inflation, unemployment, corruption, and crime. The country joined NATO in 2004 and the EU in 2007.","geo":{"Location":"Southeastern Europe, bordering the Black Sea, between Romania and Turkey","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":43,"min":0},"E":{"deg":25,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total:":{"quantity":110879,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world:":"","land:":{"quantity":108489,"unit":"sq km"},"water:":{"quantity":2390,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly larger than Tennessee","Land boundaries":{"total:":{"quantity":1808,"unit":"km"},"border countries:":"Greece 494 km, Macedonia 148 km, Romania 608 km, Serbia 318 km, Turkey 240 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":354,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea:":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone:":{"quantity":24,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone:":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"}},"Climate":"temperate;

Only one in two children go to school, and approximately one in 15 adults has HIV/AIDS. Food, medicine, and electricity remain in short supply. Less than 2% of the population has electricity in its homes. Burundi's GDP grew around 4% annually in 2006-10. Political stability and the end of the civil war have improved aid flows and economic activity has increased, but underlying weaknesses - a high poverty rate, poor education rates, a weak legal system, a poor transportation network, overburdened utilities, and low administrative capacity - risk undermining planned economic reforms. The purchasing power of most Burundians has decreased as wage increases have not kept up with inflation. Burundi will continue to remain heavily dependent on aid from bilateral and multilateral donors; the delay of funds after a corruption scandal cut off bilateral aid in 2007 reduced government's revenues and its ability to pay salaries. Burundi joined the East African Community, which should boost Burundi's regional trade ties, and received $700 million in debt relief in 2009. Government corruption is also hindering the development of a healthy private sector as companies seek to navigate an environment with ever-changing rules.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":3397000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":1489000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":3.9,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":31.6,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":21.4,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":47,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":4245000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":93.6,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":2.3,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":4.1,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":"NA%","Population below poverty line":{"quantity":68,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":4.1,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":28,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":42.4,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":25.1,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":386300000},"expenditures:":{"usd":476200000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":9.8,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":10,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":14.08,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":329300000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":568300000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":465700000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Agriculture - products":"coffee, cotton, tea, corn, sorghum, sweet potatoes, bananas, manioc (tapioca); beef, milk, hides","Industries":"light consumer goods such as blankets, shoes, soap; assembly of imported components; public works construction; food processing","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":7,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":92000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":125600000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":"40 million kWh; note - supplied by the Democratic Republic of the Congo (2007 est.)","Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":3000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":2495,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-136 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":71000000},"Exports - commodities":"coffee, tea, sugar, cotton, hides","Exports - partners":"Germany 21.6%, Switzerland 14.86%, Belgium 9.32%, Sweden 8.94%, Pakistan 5.82% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":336000000},"Imports - commodities":"capital goods, petroleum products, foodstuffs","Imports - partners":"Saudi Arabia 16.87%, Belgium 11.17%, Uganda 8.62%, Kenya 7.57%, China 5.66%, France 5.35%, Germany 4.46%, India 4.24%, Tanzania 4.21% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":320000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":1200000000},"Exchange rates":"Burundi francs (BIF) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"ca","name":"Canada","region":"North America","background":"A land of vast distances and rich natural resources, Canada became a self-governing dominion in 1867 while retaining ties to the British crown.

Since World War II, the impressive growth of the manufacturing, mining, and service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural economy into one primarily industrial and urban. The 1989 US-Canada Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) (which includes Mexico) touched off a dramatic increase in trade and economic integration with the US, its principal trading partner. Canada enjoys a substantial trade surplus with the US, which absorbs about three-fourths of Canadian exports each year. Canada is the US's largest foreign supplier of energy, including oil, gas, uranium, and electric power. Given its great natural resources, skilled labor force, and modern capital plant, Canada enjoyed solid economic growth from 1993 through 2007. Buffeted by the global economic crisis, the economy dropped into a sharp recession in the final months of 2008, and Ottawa posted its first fiscal deficit in 2009 after 12 years of surplus. Canada's major banks, however, emerged from the financial crisis of 2008-09 among the strongest in the world, owing to the financial sector's tradition of conservative lending practices and strong capitalization. During 2010, Canada's economy grew only 3%, due to decreased global demand and a highly valued Canadian dollar.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":1330000000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":1574000000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":3.1,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":2,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":20,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":78,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":18590000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":2,"unit":"%"},"manufacturing:":{"quantity":13,"unit":"%"},"construction:":{"quantity":6,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":76,"unit":"%"},"other:":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":8,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":9.4,"unit":"%"}},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":0.1,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":46,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":32.1,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":22.1,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":605700000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":677700000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":34,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1.6,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":1,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":560800000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":1469000000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":2963000000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":1681000000000},"Agriculture - products":"wheat, barley, oilseed, tobacco, fruits, vegetables; dairy products; forest products; fish","Industries":"transportation equipment, chemicals, processed and unprocessed minerals, food products, wood and paper products, fish products, petroleum and natural gas","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":5.8,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":620700000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":536100000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":55730000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":23500000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":3289000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":2151000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":2001000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":1192000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":175200000000,"unit":"bbl"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":161300000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":94620000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":94670000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":16590000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":1754000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-40.21 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":406800000000},"Exports - commodities":"motor vehicles and parts, industrial machinery, aircraft, telecommunications equipment; chemicals, plastics, fertilizers; wood pulp, timber, crude petroleum, natural gas, electricity, aluminum","Exports - partners":"US 75.02%, UK 3.37%, China 3.09% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":406400000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery and equipment, motor vehicles and parts, crude oil, chemicals, electricity, durable consumer goods","Imports - partners":"US 51.1%, China 10.88%, Mexico 4.56% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":"$NA (31 December 2010 est.)","Debt - external":{"usd":1008999999999.9999},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":528700000000.00006},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":602500000000},"Exchange rates":"Canadian dollars (CAD) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"cb","name":"Cambodia","region":"East & Southeast Asia","background":"Most Cambodians consider themselves to be Khmers, descendants of the Angkor Empire that extended over much of Southeast Asia and reached its zenith between the 10th and 13th centuries. Attacks by the Thai and Cham (from present-day Vietnam) weakened the empire, ushering in a long period of decline. The king placed the country under French protection in 1863 and it became part of French Indochina in 1887. Following Japanese occupation in World War II, Cambodia gained full independence from France in 1953. In April 1975, after a five-year struggle, Communist Khmer Rouge forces captured Phnom Penh and evacuated all cities and towns. At least 1.5 million Cambodians died from execution, forced hardships, or starvation during the Khmer Rouge regime under POL POT. A December 1978 Vietnamese invasion drove the Khmer Rouge into the countryside, began a 10-year Vietnamese occupation, and touched off almost 13 years of civil war. The 1991 Paris Peace Accords mandated democratic elections and a ceasefire, which was not fully respected by the Khmer Rouge. UN-sponsored elections in 1993 helped restore some semblance of normalcy under a coalition government. Factional fighting in 1997 ended the first coalition government, but a second round of national elections in 1998 led to the formation of another coalition government and renewed political stability. The remaining elements of the Khmer Rouge surrendered in early 1999. Some of the surviving Khmer Rouge leaders have been tried or are awaiting trial for crimes against humanity by a hybrid UN-Cambodian tribunal supported by international assistance. Elections in July 2003 were relatively peaceful, but it took one year of negotiations between contending political parties before a coalition government was formed. In October 2004, King Norodom SIHANOUK abdicated the throne and his son, Prince Norodom SIHAMONI, was selected to succeed him. Local elections were held in Cambodia in April 2007, with little of the pre-election violence that preceded prior elections. National elections in July 2008 were relatively peaceful.","geo":{"Location":"Southeastern Asia, bordering the Gulf of Thailand, between Thailand, Vietnam, and Laos","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":13,"min":0},"E":{"deg":105,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total:":{"quantity":181035,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world:":"","land:":{"quantity":176515,"unit":"sq km"},"water:":{"quantity":4520,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than Oklahoma","Land boundaries":{"total:":{"quantity":2572,"unit":"km"},"border countries:":"Laos 541 km, Thailand 803 km, Vietnam 1,228 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":443,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea:":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone:":{"quantity":24,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone:":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf:":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"}},"Climate":"tropical;

GDP contracted slightly in 2009 as a result of the global economic slowdown, but climbed more than 4% in 1010, driven by renewed exports. With the January 2005 expiration of a WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing, Cambodian textile producers were forced to compete directly with lower-priced countries such as China, India, Vietnam, and Bangladesh. The garment industry currently employs more than 280,000 people - about 5% of the work force - and contributes more than 70% of Cambodia's exports. In 2005, exploitable oil deposits were found beneath Cambodia's territorial waters, representing a new revenue stream for the government if commercial extraction begins. Mining also is attracting significant investor interest, particularly in the northern parts of the country. The government has said opportunities exist for mining bauxite, gold, iron and gems. In 2006, a US-Cambodia bilateral Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) was signed, and several rounds of discussions have been held since 2007. Rubber exports increased about 25% in 2009 due to rising global demand. The tourism industry has continued to grow rapidly, with foreign arrivals exceeding 2 million per year in 2007-08; however, economic troubles abroad dampened growth in 2009. The global financial crisis is weakening demand for Cambodian exports, and construction is declining due to a shortage of credit. The long-term development of the economy remains a daunting challenge. The Cambodian government is working with bilateral and multilateral donors, including the World Bank and IMF, to address the country's many pressing needs. The major economic challenge for Cambodia over the next decade will be fashioning an economic environment in which the private sector can create enough jobs to handle Cambodia's demographic imbalance. More than 50% of the population is less than 25 years old. The population lacks education and productive skills, particularly in the poverty-ridden countryside, which suffers from an almost total lack of basic infrastructure.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":30180000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":11630000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":6,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":33.4,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":21.4,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":45.2,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":8800000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":57.6,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":15.9,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":26.5,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":3.5,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":31,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":34.2,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":43,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":23,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":1413000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":2079000000.0000002}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":4.1,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":"NA% (31 December 2008)","Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":17,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":850700000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":4982000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":2195000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Agriculture - products":"rice, rubber, corn, vegetables, cashews, tapioca, silk","Industries":"tourism, garments, construction, rice milling, fishing, wood and wood products, rubber, cement, gem mining, textiles","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":5.7,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":1273000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":1272000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":167000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":4000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":30970,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-918 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":4687000000},"Exports - commodities":"clothing, timber, rubber, rice, fish, tobacco, footwear","Exports - partners":"US 45.32%, Singapore 9.46%, Germany 7.52%, UK 7.07%, Canada 6.31%, Vietnam 4.15% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":6005000000},"Imports - commodities":"petroleum products, cigarettes, gold, construction materials, machinery, motor vehicles, pharmaceutical products","Imports - partners":"Thailand 24.83%, Vietnam 19.73%, China 14.08%, Singapore 11.34%, Hong Kong 7.41%, Taiwan 5.1%, South Korea 4.06% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":3840000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":4338000000},"Exchange rates":"riels (KHR) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"cc","name":"Curacao","region":"Central America and Caribbean","background":"Originally settled by Arawak Indians, Curacao was seized by the Dutch in 1634 along with the neighboring island of Bonaire.

Additionally, Sri Lanka seeks to reduce poverty by using a combination of state directed policies and private investment promotion to spur growth in disadvantaged areas, develop small and medium enterprises, and promote increased agriculture. High levels of government funding may be difficult, as the government already is faced with high debt interest payments, a bloated civil service, and historically high budget deficits. The 2008-09 global financial crisis and recession exposed Sri Lanka's economic vulnerabilities and nearly caused a balance of payments crisis, which was alleviated by a $2.6 billion IMF standby agreement in July 2009. The end of the civil war and the IMF loan, however, have largely restored investors' confidence, reflected in part by the Sri Lankan stock market's recognition as one of the best performing markets in the world. Sri Lankan growth rates averaged nearly 5% in during the war, but increased government spending on development and fighting the LTTE in the final years spurred GDP growth to around 6-7% per year in 2006-08. After experiencing 3.5% growth in 2009, Sri Lanka's economy is poised to achieve high growth rates in the postwar period.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":106500000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":49680000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":9.1,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":12.6,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":29.8,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":57.6,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":8100000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":32.7,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":26.3,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":41,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":5.4,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":23,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":1.1,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":39.7,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":49,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":23.6,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":7415000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":11180000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":86.7,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":5.6,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":7.5,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":10.91,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":4400000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":19720000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":18340000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":8132999999.999999},"Agriculture - products":"rice, sugarcane, grains, pulses, oilseed, spices, vegetables, fruit, tea, rubber, coconuts; milk, eggs, hides, beef; fish","Industries":"processing of rubber, tea, coconuts, tobacco and other agricultural commodities; telecommunications, insurance, banking; tourism, shipping; clothing, textiles; cement, petroleum refining, information technology services, construction","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":6.9,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":9901000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":8417000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":90000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":968.4,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":87690,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-1.784 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":7908000000},"Exports - commodities":"textiles and apparel, tea and spices; rubber manufactures; precious stones; coconut products, fish","Exports - partners":"US 20.59%, UK 12.87%, Italy 5.51%, Germany 5.29%, India 4.54%, Belgium 4.43% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":11600000000},"Imports - commodities":"petroleum, textiles, machinery and transportation equipment, building materials, mineral products, foodstuffs","Imports - partners":"India 20.73%, China 13.45%, Singapore 7.26%, Iran 6.7%, South Korea 5.23% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":5630000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":17970000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":"$NA","Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA","Exchange rates":"Sri Lankan rupees (LKR) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"cf","name":"Congo, Republic of the","region":"Africa","background":"Upon independence in 1960, the former French region of Middle Congo became the Republic of the Congo.

Oil has supplanted forestry as the mainstay of the economy, providing a major share of government revenues and exports. In the early 1980s, rapidly rising oil revenues enabled the government to finance large-scale development projects with GDP growth averaging 5% annually, one of the highest rates in Africa. Characterized by budget problems and overstaffing, the government has mortgaged a substantial portion of its oil earnings through oil-backed loans that have contributed to a growing debt burden and chronic revenue shortfalls. Economic reform efforts have been undertaken with the support of international organizations, notably the World Bank and the IMF. However, the reform program came to a halt in June 1997 when civil war erupted. Denis SASSOU-Nguesso, who returned to power when the war ended in October 1997, publicly expressed interest in moving forward on economic reforms and privatization and in renewing cooperation with international financial institutions. Economic progress was badly hurt by slumping oil prices and the resumption of armed conflict in December 1998, which worsened the republic's budget deficit. The current administration presides over an uneasy internal peace and faces difficult economic challenges of stimulating recovery and reducing poverty. The drop in oil prices during the global crisis reduced oil revenue by about 30%, but the subsequent recovery of oil prices has boosted the economy's GDP and near-term prospects. In March 2006, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) treatment for Congo, receiving $1.9 billion in debt relief under the program in 2010.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":17110000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":11530000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":9.1,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":4.4,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":63.7,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":32,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":1514000,"Unemployment rate":"NA%","Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":2.1,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":37.1,"unit":"%"}},"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":41.5,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":3818000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":2599000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":5.2,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":4.25,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":"NA%","Stock of narrow money":{"usd":2403000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":2746000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":1580000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Agriculture - products":"cassava (tapioca), sugar, rice, corn, peanuts, vegetables, coffee, cocoa; forest products","Industries":"petroleum extraction, cement, lumber, brewing, sugar, palm oil, soap, flour, cigarettes","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":12,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":400000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":471000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":449000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":274400,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":10000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":241100,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":2136,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":1600000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":180000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":180000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":90610000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-569 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":9200000000},"Exports - commodities":"petroleum, lumber, plywood, sugar, cocoa, coffee, diamonds","Exports - partners":"US 40.08%, China 30.18%, France 8.17%, Taiwan 6.4%, India 4.2% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":3607000000},"Imports - commodities":"capital equipment, construction materials, foodstuffs","Imports - partners":"France 20.64%, China 14.54%, Italy 9.56%, US 9.02%, India 5.55%, Belgium 4.51% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":4123000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":5000000000},"Exchange rates":"Cooperation Financiere en Afrique Centrale francs per US dollar -"}},{"id":"cg","name":"Congo, Democratic Republic of the","region":"Africa","background":"Established as a Belgian colony in 1908, the then-Republic of the Congo gained its independence in 1960, but its early years were marred by political and social instability. Col. Joseph MOBUTU seized power and declared himself president in a November 1965 coup. He subsequently changed his name - to MOBUTU Sese Seko - as well as that of the country - to Zaire. MOBUTU retained his position for 32 years through several sham elections, as well as through brutal force. Ethnic strife and civil war, touched off by a massive inflow of refugees in 1994 from fighting in Rwanda and Burundi, led in May 1997 to the toppling of the MOBUTU regime by a rebellion backed by Rwanda and Uganda and fronted by Laurent KABILA. He renamed the country the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), but in August 1998 his regime was itself challenged by a second insurrection again backed by Rwanda and Uganda. Troops from Angola, Chad, Namibia, Sudan, and Zimbabwe intervened to support KABILA's regime. A cease-fire was signed in July 1999 by the DRC, Congolese armed rebel groups, Angola, Namibia, Rwanda, Uganda, and Zimbabwe but sporadic fighting continued. Laurent KABILA was assassinated in January 2001 and his son, Joseph KABILA, was named head of state. In October 2002, the new president was successful in negotiating the withdrawal of Rwandan forces occupying eastern Congo; two months later, the Pretoria Accord was signed by all remaining warring parties to end the fighting and establish a government of national unity. A transitional government was set up in July 2003. Joseph KABILA as president and four vice presidents represented the former government, former rebel groups, the political opposition, and civil society. The transitional government held a successful constitutional referendum in December 2005 and elections for the presidency, National Assembly, and provincial legislatures in 2006. The National Assembly was installed in September 2006 and KABILA was inaugurated president in December 2006. Provincial assemblies were constituted in early 2007, and elected governors and national senators in January 2007.

Systemic corruption since independence in 1960 and conflict that began in May 1997 has dramatically reduced national output and government revenue, increased external debt, and resulted in the deaths of more than 5 million people from violence, famine, and disease. Foreign businesses curtailed operations due to uncertainty about the outcome of the conflict, lack of infrastructure, and the difficult operating environment. Conditions began to improve in late 2002 with the withdrawal of a large portion of the invading foreign troops. The transitional government reopened relations with international financial institutions and international donors, and President KABILA began implementing reforms. Progress has been slow and the International Monetary Fund curtailed their program for the DRC at the end of March 2006 because of fiscal overruns. Much economic activity still occurs in the informal sector, and is not reflected in GDP data. Renewed activity in the mining sector, the source of most export income, boosted Kinshasa's fiscal position and GDP growth from 2006-2008, however, the government's review of mining contracts that began in 2006, combined with a fall in world market prices for the DRC's key mineral exports temporarily weakened output in 2009, leading to a balance of payments crisis. The recovery in mineral prices beginning in mid 2009 boosted mineral exports, and emergency funds from the IMF boosted foreign reserves.

Reforms began with the phasing out of collectivized agriculture, and expanded to include the gradual liberalization of prices, fiscal decentralization, increased autonomy for state enterprises, creation of a diversified banking system, development of stock markets, rapid growth of the private sector, and opening to foreign trade and investment. China has implemented reforms in a gradualist fashion. In recent years, China has renewed its support for state-owned enterprises in sectors it considers important to \"economic security,\" explicitly looking to foster globally competitive national champions. After keeping its currency tightly linked to the US dollar for years, in July 2005 China revalued its currency by 2.1% against the US dollar and moved to an exchange rate system that references a basket of currencies. From mid 2005 to late 2008 cumulative appreciation of the renminbi against the US dollar was more than 20%, but the exchange rate remained virtually pegged to the dollar from the onset of the global financial crisis until June 2010, when Beijing allowed resumption of a gradual appreciation. The restructuring of the economy and resulting efficiency gains have contributed to a more than tenfold increase in GDP since 1978. Measured on a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis that adjusts for price differences, China in 2010 stood as the second-largest economy in the world after the US, having surpassed Japan in 2001. The dollar values of China's agricultural and industrial output each exceed those of the US; China is second to the US in the value of services it produces. Still, per capita income is below the world average. The Chinese government faces numerous economic challenges, including: (a) reducing its high domestic savings rate and correspondingly low domestic demand; (b) sustaining adequate job growth for tens of millions of migrants and new entrants to the work force; (c) reducing corruption and other economic crimes; and (d) containing environmental damage and social strife related to the economy's rapid transformation. Economic development has progressed further in coastal provinces than in the interior, and approximately 200 million rural laborers and their dependents have relocated to urban areas to find work. One consequence of the \"one child\" policy is that China is now one of the most rapidly aging countries in the world. Deterioration in the environment - notably air pollution, soil erosion, and the steady fall of the water table, especially in the north - is another long-term problem. China continues to lose arable land because of erosion and economic development. The Chinese government is seeking to add energy production capacity from sources other than coal and oil, focusing on nuclear and alternative energy development. In 2009, the global economic downturn reduced foreign demand for Chinese exports for the first time in many years, but China rebounded quickly, outperforming all other major economies in 2010 with GDP growth around 10%. The economy appears set to remain on a strong growth trajectory in 2011, lending credibility to the stimulus policies the regime rolled out during the global financial crisis. The government vows, in the 12th Five-Year Plan adopted in March 2011, to continue reforming the economy and emphasizes the need to increase domestic consumption in order to make the economy less dependent on exports for GDP growth in the future. However, China likely will make only marginal progress toward these rebalancing goals in 2011. Two economic problems China currently faces are inflation - which, late in 2010, surpassed the government's target of 3% - and local government debt, which swelled as a result of stimulus policies, and is largely off-the-books and potentially low-quality.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":10090000000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":5878000000000}},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":10.3,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":9.6,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":46.8,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":43.6,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":780000000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":38.1,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":27.8,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":34.1,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":4.3,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Population below poverty line":{"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":2.8,"unit":"%"}},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":3.5,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":15,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":41.5,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":47.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":1149000000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":1270000000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":17.5,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":5,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":2.79,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":5.81,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":3838000000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":10080000000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":8156000000000.001},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":5008000000000},"Agriculture - products":"world leader in gross value of agricultural output; rice, wheat, potatoes, corn, peanuts, tea, millet, barley, apples, cotton, oilseed; pork; fish","Industries":"world leader in gross value of industrial output; mining and ore processing, iron, steel, aluminum, and other metals, coal; machine building; armaments; textiles and apparel; petroleum; cement; chemicals; fertilizers; consumer products, including footwear, toys, and electronics; food processing; transportation equipment, including automobiles, rail cars and locomotives, ships, and aircraft; telecommunications equipment, commercial space launch vehicles, satellites","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":11,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":3451000000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":3438000000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":16640000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":3842000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":3991000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":8199999.999999999,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":388000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":4393000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":20350000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":82940000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":87080000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":3320000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":7462000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":3030000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":272500000000},"Exports":{"usd":1506000000000},"Exports - commodities":"electrical and other machinery, including data processing equipment, apparel, textiles, iron and steel, optical and medical equipment","Exports - partners":"US 20.03%, Hong Kong 12.03%, Japan 8.32%, South Korea 4.55%, Germany 4.27% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":1307000000000},"Imports - commodities":"electrical and other machinery, oil and mineral fuels, optical and medical equipment, metal ores, plastics, organic chemicals","Imports - partners":"Japan 12.27%, Hong Kong 10.06%, South Korea 9.04%, US 7.66%, Taiwan 6.84%, Germany 5.54% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":2622000000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":406600000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":574300000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":278900000000},"Exchange rates":"Renminbi yuan (RMB) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"ci","name":"Chile","region":"South America","background":"Prior to the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, the Inca ruled northern Chile while the indigenous Mapuche inhabited central and southern Chile.

Exports account for more than one-fourth of GDP, with commodities making up some three-quarters of total exports. Copper alone provides one-third of government revenue. During the early 1990s, Chile's reputation as a role model for economic reform was strengthened when the democratic government of Patricio AYLWIN - which took over from the military in 1990 - deepened the economic reform initiated by the military government. Since 1999, growth has averaged 4% per year. Chile deepened its longstanding commitment to trade liberalization with the signing of a free trade agreement with the US, which took effect on 1 January 2004. Chile claims to have more bilateral or regional trade agreements than any other country. It has 57 such agreements (not all of them full free trade agreements), including with the European Union, Mercosur, China, India, South Korea, and Mexico. Over the past seven years, foreign direct investment inflows have quadrupled to some $15 billion in 2010, but FDI had dropped to about $7 billion in 2009 in the face of diminished investment throughout the world. The Chilean government conducts a rule-based countercyclical fiscal policy, accumulating surpluses in sovereign wealth funds during periods of high copper prices and economic growth, and allowing deficit spending only during periods of low copper prices and growth. As of September 2008, those sovereign wealth funds - kept mostly outside the country and separate from Central Bank reserves - amounted to more than $20 billion. Chile used $4 billion from this fund to finance a fiscal stimulus package to fend off recession. In December 2009, the OECD invited Chile to become a full member, after a two year period of compliance with organization mandates, and in May 2010 Chile signed the OECD Convention, becoming the first South American country to join the OECD. The economy started to show signs of a rebound in the fourth quarter of 2009, and GDP grew more than 5% in 2010.

The IMF is pressing for more reforms, including increased budget transparency, privatization, and poverty reduction programs. Weak prices for oil led to the significant slowdown in growth in 2010.

The low educational level of the labor force contributes to a subsistence level of economic activity, high unemployment, and a heavy dependence on foreign grants and technical assistance. Agriculture, including fishing, hunting, and forestry, contributes 40% to GDP, employs 80% of the labor force, and provides most of the exports. Export income is heavily reliant on the three main crops of vanilla, cloves, and ylang-ylang and Comoros' export earnings are easily disrupted by disasters such as fires. The country is not self-sufficient in food production; rice, the main staple, accounts for the bulk of imports. The government - which is hampered by internal political disputes - lacks a comprehensive strategy to attract foreign investment and is struggling to upgrade education and technical training, privatize commercial and industrial enterprises, improve health services, diversify exports, promote tourism, and reduce the high population growth rate. Political problems have inhibited growth, which has averaged only about 1% in 2006-09. Remittances from 150,000 Comorans abroad help supplement GDP. In September 2009 the IMF approved Comoros for a three-year $21 million loan. The IMF gave generally positive reports of the country's program performance as of October 2010. The African Development Bank approved a $34.6 million debt-relief package loan for Comoros in September 2010, and Comoros will attempt to qualify for debt relief in 2012 under the IMF and World Bank's Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":800000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":534000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":2.1,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":40,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":4,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":56,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":268500,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":80,"unit":"%"},"industry and services:":{"quantity":20,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":20,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":60,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":0.9,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":55.2,"unit":"%"}},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":27600000},"expenditures:":"$NA (2001 est.)"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":2.21,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":10.5,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":104700000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":168600000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":79750000},"Agriculture - products":"vanilla, cloves, ylang-ylang (perfume essence), copra, coconuts, bananas, cassava (tapioca)","Industries":"fishing, tourism, perfume distillation","Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Electricity - production":{"quantity":22000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":20460000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":1000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":766.2,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":8000000},"Exports":{"usd":32000000},"Exports - commodities":"vanilla, ylang-ylang (perfume essence), cloves, copra","Exports - partners":"Turkey 25.2%, France 20.44%, Singapore 17.44%, Algeria 8.02%, Italy 6.09%, Saudi Arabia 5% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":143000000},"Imports - commodities":"rice and other foodstuffs, consumer goods, petroleum products, cement, transport equipment","Imports - partners":"France 15.5%, China 14.66%, India 10.55%, UAE 7.88%, Pakistan 5.69%, Kenya 4.51% (2009)","Debt - external":{"usd":232000000},"Exchange rates":"Comoran francs (KMF) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"co","name":"Colombia","region":"South America","background":"Colombia was one of the three countries that emerged from the collapse of Gran Colombia in 1830 (the others are Ecuador and Venezuela).

The insurgents lack the military or popular support necessary to overthrow the government, and violence has been decreasing since about 2002. However, insurgents continue attacks against civilians and large areas of the countryside are under guerrilla influence or are contested by security forces. More than 31,000 former paramilitaries had demobilized by the end of 2006 and the United Self Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) as a formal organization had ceased to function. In the wake of the paramilitary demobilization, emerging criminal groups arose, whose members include some former paramilitaries. The Colombian Government has stepped up efforts to reassert government control throughout the country, and now has a presence in every one of its administrative departments. However, neighboring countries worry about the violence spilling over their borders.

agriculture; infrastructure; housing; and innovation. Colombia is third largest exporter of oil to the United States. President SANTOS, inaugurated in August 2010, introduced unprecedented legislation to better distribute extractive industry royalties and compensate Colombians who lost their land due to decades of violence. He also seeks to build on improvements in domestic security and on President URIBE's promarket economic policies. Foreign direct investment reached a record $10 billion in 2008, but dropped to $7.2 billion in 2009, before beginning to recover in 2010, notably in the oil sector. Pro-business reforms in the oil and gas sectors and export-led growth, fueled mainly by the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act, have enhanced Colombia's investment climate. Inequality, underemployment, and narcotrafficking remain significant challenges, and Colombia's infrastructure requires major improvements to sustain economic expansion. Because of the global financial crisis and weakening demand for Colombia's exports, Colombia's economy grew only 2.7% in 2008, and 0.8% in 2009 but rebounded to around 4.4% in 2010. In late 2010, Colombia experienced its most severe flooding in decades, with damages estimated to exceed $6 billion. The government has encouraged exporters to diversify their customer base beyond the United States and Venezuela, traditionally Colombia's largest trading partners; the SANTOS administration continues to pursue free trade agreements with Asian and South American partners and a trade accord with Canada is expected to go into effect in 2011, while a negotiated trade agreement with the EU has yet to be approved by the EU parliament. Improved relations with Venezuela have eased worries about restrictions on bilateral trade, but the business sector remains concerned about the pending US Congressional approval of the US-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":435400000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":285500000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":4.3,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":9.3,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":38,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":52.7,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":21270000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":18,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":13,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":68,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":11.8,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":45.5,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":0.8,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":45,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":58.5,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":22.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":74200000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":83900000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":44.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":3.1,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":12.98,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":31830000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":104900000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":123000000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":217300000000},"Agriculture - products":"coffee, cut flowers, bananas, rice, tobacco, corn, sugarcane, cocoa beans, oilseed, vegetables; forest products; shrimp","Industries":"textiles, food processing, oil, clothing and footwear, beverages, chemicals, cement; gold, coal, emeralds","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":5.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":50580000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":38590000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":876700000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":39400000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":785000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":288000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":294000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":16540,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":1900000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":9000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":8100000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":900000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":112000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-5.946 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":40240000000},"Exports - commodities":"petroleum, coffee, coal, nickel, emeralds, apparel, bananas, cut flowers","Exports - partners":"US 42%, EU 12.6%, China 5.2%, Ecuador 4.5% (2010 est.)","Imports":{"usd":36260000000},"Imports - commodities":"industrial equipment, transportation equipment, consumer goods, chemicals, paper products, fuels, electricity","Imports - partners":"US 25.5%, China 13.4%, Mexico 9.4%, Brazil 5.9%, Germany 4.1% (2010 est.)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":28500000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":57740000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":84620000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":19200000000},"Exchange rates":"Colombian pesos (COP) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"cq","name":"Northern Mariana Islands","region":"Australia-Oceania","background":"Under US administration as part of the UN Trust Territory of the Pacific, the people of the Northern Mariana Islands decided in the 1970s not to seek independence but instead to forge closer links with the US.

In 1821, Costa Rica became one of several Central American provinces that jointly declared their independence from Spain. Two years later it joined the United Provinces of Central America, but this federation disintegrated in 1838, at which time Costa Rica proclaimed its sovereignty and independence. Since the late 19th century, only two brief periods of violence have marred the country's democratic development. In 1949, Costa Rica dissolved its armed forces.

The economy contracted 0.7% in 2009, but resumed growth at more than 3% in 2010. While the traditional agricultural exports of bananas, coffee, sugar, and beef are still the backbone of commodity export trade, a variety of industrial and specialized agricultural products have broadened export trade in recent years. High value added goods and services, including microchips, have further bolstered exports. Tourism continues to bring in foreign exchange, as Costa Rica's impressive biodiversity makes it a key destination for ecotourism. Foreign investors remain attracted by the country's political stability and relatively high education levels, as well as the fiscal incentives offered in the free-trade zones; and Costa Rica has attracted one of the highest levels of foreign direct investment per capita in Latin America. However, many business impediments, such as high levels of bureaucracy, difficulty of enforcing contracts, and weak investor protection, remain. Poverty has remained around 15-20% for nearly 20 years, and the strong social safety net that had been put into place by the government has eroded due to increased financial constraints on government expenditures. Unlike the rest of Central America, Costa Rica is not highly dependent on remittances as they only represent about 2% of GDP. Immigration from Nicaragua has increasingly become a concern for the government. The estimated 300,000-500,000 Nicaraguans in Costa Rica legally and illegally are an important source of - mostly unskilled - labor, but also place heavy demands on the social welfare system. The US-Central American-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) entered into force on 1 January 2009, after significant delays within the Costa Rican legislature. CAFTA-DR will likely lead to increased foreign direct investment in key sectors of the economy, including the insurance and telecommunications sectors recently opened to private investors. President CHINCHILLA is likely to push for fiscal reform in the coming year, seeking to boost revenue, possibly through revised tax legislation, to fund an increase in security services and education.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":51170000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":35780000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":4.2,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":6.3,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":22.9,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":70.8,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":{"Labor force":2170000,"country comparison to the world:":""},"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":14,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":22,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":64,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":7.3,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":16,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":1.5,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":35.5,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":48,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":20.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":5085000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":6921000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":42.4,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":5.8,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":23,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":17.4,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":4504000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":16809999999.999998},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":15820000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":1452000000},"Agriculture - products":"bananas, pineapples, coffee, melons, ornamental plants, sugar, corn, rice, beans, potatoes; beef, poultry, dairy; timber","Industries":"microprocessors, food processing, medical equipment, textiles and clothing, construction materials, fertilizer, plastic products","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":9290000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":8250000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":77160000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":203200000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":44000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":2117,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":46260,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-1.349 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":10010000000},"Exports - commodities":"bananas, pineapples, coffee, melons, ornamental plants, sugar; beef; seafood; electronic components, medical equipment","Exports - partners":"US 32.61%, Netherlands 12.82%, China 11.81%, Mexico 4.2% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":13320000000},"Imports - commodities":"raw materials, consumer goods, capital equipment, petroleum, construction materials","Imports - partners":"US 44.72%, Mexico 7.65%, Venezuela 5.56%, China 5.15%, Japan 4.36% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":4584000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":8550000000.000001},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":13920000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":547000000},"Exchange rates":"Costa Rican colones (CRC) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"ct","name":"Central African Republic","region":"Africa","background":"The former French colony of Ubangi-Shari became the Central African Republic upon independence in 1960.

The average Cuban's standard of living remains at a lower level than before the downturn of the 1990s, which was caused by the loss of Soviet aid and domestic inefficiencies.

The fishing potential, mostly lobster and tuna, is not fully exploited. Cape Verde annually runs a high trade deficit financed by foreign aid and remittances from its large pool of emigrants; remittances supplement GDP by more than 20%. Despite the lack of resources, sound economic management has produced steadily improving incomes. Continued economic reforms are aimed at developing the private sector and attracting foreign investment to diversify the economy. Future prospects depend heavily on the maintenance of aid flows, the encouragement of tourism, remittances, and the momentum of the government's development program.

Tensions between the Greek Cypriot majority and Turkish Cypriot minority came to a head in December 1963, when violence broke out in the capital of Nicosia. Despite the deployment of UN peacekeepers in 1964, sporadic intercommunal violence continued forcing most Turkish Cypriots into enclaves throughout the island. In 1974, a Greek Government-sponsored attempt to seize control of Cyprus was met by military intervention from Turkey, which soon controlled more than a third of the island. In 1983, the Turkish Cypriot-occupied area declared itself the \"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus\" (\"TRNC\"), but it is recognized only by Turkey. The election of a new Cypriot president in 2008 served as the impetus for the UN to encourage both the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities to reopen unification negotiations. In September 2008, the leaders of the two communities began negotiations under UN auspices aimed at reuniting the divided island; the talks remain ongoing.

Tourism, financial services, and real estate are the most important sectors. Erratic growth rates over the past decade reflect the economy's reliance on tourism, the profitability of which often fluctuates with political instability in the region and economic conditions in Western Europe. Nevertheless, the economy in the area under government control has grown at a rate well above the EU average since 2000. Cyprus joined the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM2) in May 2005 and adopted the euro as its national currency on 1 January 2008. An aggressive austerity program in the preceding years, aimed at paving the way for the euro, helped turn a soaring fiscal deficit (6.3% in 2003) into a surplus of 1.2% in 2008, and reduced inflation to 4.7%. This prosperity came under pressure in 2009, as construction and tourism slowed in the face of reduced foreign demand triggered by the ongoing global financial crisis. Although Cyprus lagged behind its EU peers in showing signs of stress from the global crisis, the economy tipped into recession in 2009, contracting by 1.8%, and has been slow to bounce back since, posting an anemic growth rate of 0.6% in 2010. In addition, the budget deficit is on the rise and reached 5.7% of GDP in 2010, a violation of the EU's budget deficit criteria of no more than 3% of GDP. In response to the country's deteriorating finances, Nicosia is promising to implement measures to cut the cost of the state payroll, curb tax evasion, and revamp social benefits. However, it has been slow to act, lacking a consensus in parliament and among the social partners for its proposed measures.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":23190000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":23170000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":1,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":2.1,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":18.6,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":79.3,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":400000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":8.5,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":20.5,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":71,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":5.6,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":"NA%","highest 10%:":"NA%"},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":29,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":19.7,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues::":{"usd":9308000000},"expenditures::":{"usd":10610000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":61.1,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":2.4,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":1.75,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":7.49,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":4341000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":50500000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":101200000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":4993000000},"Agriculture - products":"citrus, vegetables, barley, grapes, olives, vegetables; poultry, pork, lamb; dairy, cheese","Industries":"tourism, food and beverage processing, cement and gypsum production, ship repair and refurbishment, textiles, light chemicals, metal products, wood, paper, stone, and clay products","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":0.1,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":4502000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":4277000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":59000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":58930,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-2.5 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":2232000000},"Exports - commodities":"citrus, potatoes, pharmaceuticals, cement, clothing","Exports - partners":"Greece 23.83%, Germany 9.2%, UK 8.78% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":7962000000},"Imports - commodities":"consumer goods, petroleum and lubricants, machinery, transport equipment","Imports - partners":"Greece 20.18%, Italy 10.67%, UK 8.95%, Germany 8.79%, Israel 6.99%, China 5.52%, Netherlands 4.85%, France 4.01% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":"$NA (31 December 2010 est.)","Debt - external":"$NA (31 December 2010 est.)","Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":29360000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":16570000000},"Exchange rates":"euros (EUR) per US dollar -","Economy of the area administered by Turkish Cypriots":{"Economy - overview:":"The Turkish Cypriot economy has roughly half the per capita GDP of the south, and economic growth tends to be volatile, given the north's relative isolation, bloated public sector, reliance on the Turkish lira, and small market size.

Denmark is a member of the European Union (EU); Danish legislation and regulations conform to EU standards on almost all issues. Danes enjoy among the highest standards of living in the world and the Danish economy is characterized by extensive government welfare measures and an equitable distribution of income. Denmark is a net exporter of food and energy and enjoys a comfortable balance of payments surplus, but depends on imports of raw materials for the manufacturing sector. Within the EU, Denmark is among the strongest supporters of trade liberalization. After a long consumption-driven upswing, Denmark's economy began slowing in 2007 with the end of a housing boom. Housing prices dropped markedly in 2008-09. The global financial crisis has exacerbated this cyclical slowdown through increased borrowing costs and lower export demand, consumer confidence, and investment. The global financial crises cut Danish GDP by 0.9% in 2008 and 5.2% in 2009. Historically low levels of unemployment rose sharply with the recession but remain below 5%, based on the national measure, about half the level of the EU; harmonized to OECD standards the unemployment rate was about 8% at the end of 2010. Denmark made a modest recovery in 2010 in part because of increased government spending. An impending decline in the ratio of workers to retirees will be a major long-term issue. Denmark maintained a healthy budget surplus for many years up to 2008, but the budget balance swung into deficit during 2009-10. Nonetheless, Denmark's fiscal position remains among the strongest in the EU. Despite previously meeting the criteria to join the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), so far Denmark has decided not to join, although the Danish krone remains pegged to the euro.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":201700000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":310800000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":2.1,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":1.1,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":22.8,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":76.1,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":2820000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":2.5,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":20.2,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":77.3,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":4.2,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":12.1,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":1.9,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":28.7,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":29,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":17.5,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":160300000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":175900000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":46.6,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":2.6,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":1.75,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":"NA%","Stock of narrow money":{"usd":148100000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":209000000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":636500000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":186900000000},"Agriculture - products":"barley, wheat, potatoes, sugar beets; pork, dairy products; fish","Industries":"iron, steel, nonferrous metals, chemicals, food processing, machinery and transportation equipment, textiles and clothing, electronics, construction, furniture and other wood products, shipbuilding and refurbishment, windmills, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":4,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":36400000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":34299999999.999996,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":11360000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":12820000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":262100,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":166500,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":268500,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":173100,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":1060000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":8398000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":4410000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":3980000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":61300000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":14350000000},"Exports":{"usd":99370000000},"Exports - commodities":"machinery and instruments, meat and meat products, dairy products, fish, pharmaceuticals, furniture, windmills","Exports - partners":"Germany 17.53%, Sweden 12.68%, UK 8.49%, US 6.05%, Norway 6.01%, Netherlands 4.84%, France 4.57% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":90830000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery and equipment, raw materials and semimanufactures for industry, chemicals, grain and foodstuffs, consumer goods","Imports - partners":"Germany 21.07%, Sweden 13.18%, Norway 7%, Netherlands 6.97%, China 6.22%, UK 5.53% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":"$NA (31 December 2010 est.)","Debt - external":{"usd":559500000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":149600000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":199800000000},"Exchange rates":"Danish kroner (DKK) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"dj","name":"Djibouti","region":"Africa","background":"The French Territory of the Afars and the Issas became Djibouti in 1977.

Two-thirds of Djibouti's inhabitants live in the capital city; the remainder are mostly nomadic herders. Scanty rainfall limits crop production to fruits and vegetables, and most food must be imported. Djibouti provides services as both a transit port for the region and an international transshipment and refueling center. Imports and exports from landlocked neighbor Ethiopia represent 70% of port activity at Djibouti's container terminal. Djibouti has few natural resources and little industry. The nation is, therefore, heavily dependent on foreign assistance to help support its balance of payments and to finance development projects. An unemployment rate of nearly 60% in urban areas continues to be a major problem. While inflation is not a concern, due to the fixed tie of the Djiboutian franc to the US dollar, the artificially high value of the Djiboutian franc adversely affects Djibouti's balance of payments. Per capita consumption dropped an estimated 35% between 1999 and 2006 because of recession, civil war, and a high population growth rate (including immigrants and refugees). Djibouti has experienced relatively minimal impact from the global economic downturn, but its reliance on diesel-generated electricity and imported food leave average consumers vulnerable to global price shocks.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":2105000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":1140000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":4.5,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":3.2,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":14.9,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":81.9,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":351700,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":"NA%","industry:":"NA%","services:":"NA%"},"Unemployment rate":{"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":59,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":42,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":2.4,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":30.9,"unit":"%"}},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":135000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":182000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":6,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":"NA% (31 December 2009 est.)","Stock of narrow money":{"usd":577800000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":940800000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":339000000},"Agriculture - products":"fruits, vegetables; goats, sheep, camels, animal hides","Industries":"construction, agricultural processing","Electricity - production":{"quantity":280000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":260399999.99999997,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":12000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":19.18,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":8476,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-352 million (2009 est.)","Exports":{"usd":100000000},"Exports - commodities":"reexports, hides and skins, coffee (in transit)","Exports - partners":"Somalia 76.68%, France 4.89%, UAE 4.22% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":644000000},"Imports - commodities":"foods, beverages, transport equipment, chemicals, petroleum products","Imports - partners":"Saudi Arabia 16.26%, India 16.03%, China 14.26%, US 9.57%, Malaysia 6.63%, Japan 4.74% (2009)","Debt - external":{"usd":428000000},"Exchange rates":"Djiboutian francs (DJF) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"do","name":"Dominica","region":"Central America and Caribbean","background":"Dominica was the last of the Caribbean islands to be colonized by Europeans due chiefly to the fierce resistance of the native Caribs.

Christopher COLUMBUS explored and claimed the island on his first voyage in 1492; it became a springboard for Spanish conquest of the Caribbean and the American mainland. In 1697, Spain recognized French dominion over the western third of the island, which in 1804 became Haiti. The remainder of the island, by then known as Santo Domingo, sought to gain its own independence in 1821 but was conquered and ruled by the Haitians for 22 years; it finally attained independence as the Dominican Republic in 1844. In 1861, the Dominicans voluntarily returned to the Spanish Empire, but two years later they launched a war that restored independence in 1865. A legacy of unsettled, mostly non-representative rule followed, capped by the dictatorship of Rafael Leonidas TRUJILLO from 1930-61. Juan BOSCH was elected president in 1962 but was deposed in a military coup in 1963. In 1965, the United States led an intervention in the midst of a civil war sparked by an uprising to restore BOSCH. In 1966, Joaquin BALAGUER defeated BOSCH in an election to become president. BALAGUER maintained a tight grip on power for most of the next 30 years when international reaction to flawed elections forced him to curtail his term in 1996. Since then, regular competitive elections have been held in which opposition candidates have won the presidency. Former President (1996-2000) Leonel FERNANDEZ Reyna won election to a new term in 2004 following a constitutional amendment allowing presidents to serve more than one term, and was since reelected to a second consecutive term.","geo":{"Location":"Caribbean, eastern two-thirds of the island of Hispaniola, between the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean, east of Haiti","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":19,"min":0},"W":{"deg":70,"min":40}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total:":{"quantity":48670,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world:":"","land:":{"quantity":48320,"unit":"sq km"},"water:":{"quantity":350,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly more than twice the size of New Hampshire","Land boundaries":{"total:":{"quantity":360,"unit":"km"},"border countries:":"Haiti 360 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":1288,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"Maritime claims":"measured from claimed archipelagic straight baselines","territorial sea:":{"quantity":6,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone:":{"quantity":24,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone:":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf:":"200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin"},"Climate":"tropical maritime;

Remittances from the US amount to about a tenth of GDP, equivalent to almost half of exports and three-quarters of tourism receipts. The country suffers from marked income inequality; the poorest half of the population receives less than one-fifth of GDP, while the richest 10% enjoys nearly 40% of GDP. High unemployment and underemployment remains an important long-term challenge. The Central America-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) came into force in March 2007, boosting investment and exports and reducing losses to the Asian garment industry. The growth of the Dominican Republic's economy rebounded in 2010 from the global recession, and remains one of the fastest growing in the region.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":87250000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":51630000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":7.8,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":11.5,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":21,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":67.5,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":4498000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":14.6,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":22.3,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":63.1,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":14.2,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":42.2,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":1.5,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":38.7,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":49.9,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":15.4,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":7110000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":8634000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":41.7,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":6.3,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":18.14,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":4734000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":15710000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":21630000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Agriculture - products":"sugarcane, coffee, cotton, cocoa, tobacco, rice, beans, potatoes, corn, bananas; cattle, pigs, dairy products, beef, eggs","Industries":"tourism, sugar processing, ferronickel and gold mining, textiles, cement, tobacco","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":1.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":14020000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":12700000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":118000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":116200,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":470000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":470000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-3.862 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":6161000000},"Exports - commodities":"ferronickel, sugar, gold, silver, coffee, cocoa, tobacco, meats, consumer goods","Exports - partners":"US 54.08%, Haiti 9.78% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":14530000000},"Imports - commodities":"foodstuffs, petroleum, cotton and fabrics, chemicals and pharmaceuticals","Imports - partners":"US 42.79%, Venezuela 7.04%, Mexico 6.17%, Colombia 5.59% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":2705000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":13090000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":19450000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA (31 December 2010 est.)","Exchange rates":"Dominican pesos (DOP) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"dx","name":"Dhekelia","region":"Europe","background":"By terms of the 1960 Treaty of Establishment that created the independent Republic of Cyprus, the UK retained full sovereignty and jurisdiction over two areas of almost 254 square kilometers - Akrotiri and Dhekelia.

When Quito withdrew in 1830, the traditional name was changed in favor of the \"Republic of the Equator.\" Between 1904 and 1942, Ecuador lost territories in a series of conflicts with its neighbors. A border war with Peru that flared in 1995 was resolved in 1999. Although Ecuador marked 30 years of civilian governance in 2004, the period was marred by political instability. Protests in Quito contributed to the mid-term ouster of three of Ecuador's last four democratically elected Presidents. In September 2008, voters approved a new constitution, Ecuador's 20th since gaining independence. General elections, under the new constitutional framework, were held in April 2009, and voters re-elected President Rafael CORREA.","geo":{"Location":"Western South America, bordering the Pacific Ocean at the Equator, between Colombia and Peru","Geographic coordinates":{"S":{"deg":2,"min":0},"W":{"deg":77,"min":30}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total:":{"quantity":283561,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world:":"","land:":{"quantity":276841,"unit":"sq km"},"water:":{"quantity":6720,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than Nevada","Land boundaries":{"total:":{"quantity":2010,"unit":"km"},"border countries:":"Colombia 590 km, Peru 1,420 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":2237,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea:":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf:":"100 nm from 2,500-m isobath"},"Climate":"tropical along coast, becoming cooler inland at higher elevations;

In 1999/2000, Ecuador suffered a severe economic crisis, with GDP contracting by 5.3%. Poverty increased significantly, the banking system collapsed, and Ecuador defaulted on its external debt. In March 2000, the Congress approved a series of structural reforms that also provided for the adoption of the US dollar as legal tender. Dollarization stabilized the economy, and positive growth returned in the years that followed, helped by high oil prices, remittances, and increased non-traditional exports. From 2002-06 the economy grew an average of 5.2% per year, the highest five-year average in 25 years. After moderate growth in 2007, the economy reached a growth rate of 7.2% in 2008, in large part due to high global petroleum prices and increased public sector investment. President Rafael CORREA, who took office in January 2007, defaulted in December 2008 on Ecuador's sovereign debt, which, with a total face value of approximately US$3.2 billion, represented about 80% of Ecuador's private external debt. In May 2009, Ecuador bought back 91% of its \"defaulted\" bonds via an international auction. Economic policies under the CORREA administration - including an announcement in late 2009 of its intention to terminate 13 bilateral investment treaties, including one with the United States - have generated economic uncertainty and discouraged private investment. The Ecuadorian economy contracted 0.4% in 2009 due to the global financial crisis and to the sharp decline in world oil prices and remittance flows. Growth picked up to a 3.7% rate in 2010, according to Ecuadorian government estimates.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":115000000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":58910000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":3.2,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":6.4,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":35.9,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":57.7,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":"4.59 million (urban) (2010 est.)","Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":8.3,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":21.2,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":70.4,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":5,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":33.1,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":1,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":35.3,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":{"Distribution of family income - Gini index":46.9,"country comparison to the world:":""},"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":23.7,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":14480000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":18210000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":23.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":3.3,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":8.68,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":19,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":6198000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":21220000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":17470000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":4248000000},"Agriculture - products":"bananas, coffee, cocoa, rice, potatoes, manioc (tapioca), plantains, sugarcane; cattle, sheep, pigs, beef, pork, dairy products; balsa wood; fish, shrimp","Industries":"petroleum, food processing, textiles, wood products, chemicals","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":3.6,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":16420000000.000002,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":15810000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":20680000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":1120000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":485700,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":181000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":338000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":80500,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":6542000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":283200000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":283200000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":7985000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-692 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":17370000000},"Exports - commodities":"petroleum, bananas, cut flowers, shrimp, cacao, coffee, wood, fish","Exports - partners":"US 33.5%, Peru 6.8%, Chile 6.5%, Columbia 4.9% (2009 est.)","Imports":{"usd":17650000000},"Imports - commodities":"industrial materials, fuels and lubricants, nondurable consumer goods","Imports - partners":"US 25.4%, Columbia 10.6%, Venezuela 6.5%, Brazil 4.5% (2009 est.)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":3590000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":14710000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":12300000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA (31 December 2010 est.)","Exchange rates":"the US dollar became El Salvador's currency in 2001"}},{"id":"ee","name":"European Union","region":"Europe","background":"The evolution of what is today the European Union (EU) from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's hybrid intergovernmental and supranational organization of 27 countries across the European continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history.

Internationally, the EU aims to bolster Europe's trade position and its political and economic power. Because of the great differences in per capita income among member states (from $7,000 to $78,000) and in national attitudes toward issues like inflation, debt, and foreign trade, the EU faces difficulties in devising and enforcing common policies. Eleven established EU member states, under the auspices of the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), introduced the euro as their common currency on 1 January 1999 (Greece did so two years later), but the UK and Denmark have 'opt-outs' that allow them to keep their national currencies, and Sweden has not taken the steps needed to participate. Between 2004 and 2007, the EU admitted 12 countries that are, in general, less advanced economically than the other 15. Of the 12 most recent member states, only Slovenia (1 January 2007), Cyprus and Malta (1 January 2008), Slovakia (1 January 2009), and Estonia (1 January 2011) have adopted the euro; the remaining states other than the UK and Denmark are legally required to adopt the currency upon meeting EU's fiscal and monetary convergence criteria. The EU has recovered from the global financial crisis faster than expected, with business investment growing by an estimated 2% in 2010, but with public investment and housing development lagging. Strong corporate profits should enable this recovery to continue in 2011. Nevertheless, significant risks to growth remain, including, high official debts and deficits, aging populations, over-regulation of non-financial businesses, and doubts about the sustainability of the EMU. In June 2010, prompted by the Greek financial crisis, the EU and the IMF set up a $1 trillion bailout fund to rescue any EMU member in danger of default, but it has not calmed market jitters that have diminished the value of the euro. Discussions are currently under way to create a permanent European Stabilization Mechanism (ESM) in 2013, when the existing European Financial Stability Facility expires.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":14820000000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":16070000000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":1.8,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":1.8,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":25,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":73.2,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":225300000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":5.6,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":27.7,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":66.7,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":9.5,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"note - see individual country entries of member states","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":2.8,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":25.2,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":30.4,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":18.6,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1.8,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":1.75,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":7.52,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":5542000000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Stock of broad money":{"Stock of broad money":{"usd":11170000000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Stock of domestic credit":{"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":22650000000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":9903000000000},"Agriculture - products":"wheat, barley, oilseeds, sugar beets, wine, grapes; dairy products, cattle, sheep, pigs, poultry; fish","Industries":"among the world's largest and most technologically advanced, the EU industrial base includes: ferrous and non-ferrous metal production and processing, metal products, petroleum, coal, cement, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, aerospace, rail transportation equipment, passenger and commercial vehicles, construction equipment, industrial equipment, shipbuilding, electrical power equipment, machine tools and automated manufacturing systems, electronics and telecommunications equipment, fishing, food and beverage processing, furniture, paper, textiles, tourism","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":4.1,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":3078000000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":2901000000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":"NA kWh","Electricity - imports":"NA kWh","Oil - production":{"quantity":2365000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":13630000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":2196000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":8613000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":5453000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":181600000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":487900000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":"NA cu m","Natural gas - imports":"NA cu m","Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":2250000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$NA (2010)","Exports":{"Exports":{"usd":1952000000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Exports - commodities":"machinery, motor vehicles, aircraft, plastics, pharmaceuticals and other chemicals, fuels, iron and steel, nonferrous metals, wood pulp and paper products, textiles, meat, dairy products, fish, alcoholic beverages","Imports":{"Imports":{"usd":1690000000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Imports - commodities":"machinery, vehicles, aircraft, plastics, crude oil, chemicals, textiles, metals, foodstuffs, clothing","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":"$NA","Debt - external":{"Debt - external":{"usd":13720000000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":"$NA","Exchange rates":"euros per US dollar -"}},{"id":"eg","name":"Egypt","region":"Africa","background":"The regularity and richness of the annual Nile River flood, coupled with semi-isolation provided by deserts to the east and west, allowed for the development of one of the world's great civilizations. A unified kingdom arose circa 3200 B.C., and a series of dynasties ruled in Egypt for the next three millennia. The last native dynasty fell to the Persians in 341 B.C., who in turn were replaced by the Greeks, Romans, and Byzantines. It was the Arabs who introduced Islam and the Arabic language in the 7th century and who ruled for the next six centuries. A local military caste, the Mamluks took control about 1250 and continued to govern after the conquest of Egypt by the Ottoman Turks in 1517. Following the completion of the Suez Canal in 1869, Egypt became an important world transportation hub, but also fell heavily into debt. Ostensibly to protect its investments, Britain seized control of Egypt's government in 1882, but nominal allegiance to the Ottoman Empire continued until 1914. Partially independent from the UK in 1922, Egypt acquired full sovereignty with the overthrow of the British-backed monarchy in 1952. The completion of the Aswan High Dam in 1971 and the resultant Lake Nasser have altered the time-honored place of the Nile River in the agriculture and ecology of Egypt. A rapidly growing population (the largest in the Arab world), limited arable land, and dependence on the Nile all continue to overtax resources and stress society. The government has struggled to meet the demands of Egypt's growing population through economic reform and massive investment in communications and physical infrastructure.","geo":{"Location":"Northern Africa, bordering the Mediterranean Sea, between Libya and the Gaza Strip, and the Red Sea north of Sudan, and includes the Asian Sinai Peninsula","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":27,"min":0},"E":{"deg":30,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total:":{"quantity":1001,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world:":"","land:":{"quantity":995450,"unit":"sq km"},"water:":{"quantity":6000,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly more than three times the size of New Mexico","Land boundaries":{"total:":{"quantity":2665,"unit":"km"},"border countries:":"Gaza Strip 11 km, Israel 266 km, Libya 1,115 km, Sudan 1,273 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":2450,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea:":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone:":{"quantity":24,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone:":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf:":"200 m depth or to the depth of exploitation"},"Climate":"desert;

Cairo from 2004 to 2008 aggressively pursued economic reforms to attract foreign investment and facilitate GDP growth. The global financial crisis slowed the reform efforts. The budget deficit climbed to over 8% of GDP and Egypt's GDP growth slowed to 4.6% in 2009, predominately due to reduced growth in export-oriented sectors, including manufacturing and tourism, and Suez Canal revenues. In 2010, the government spent more on infrastructure and public projects, and exports drove GDP growth to more than 5%, but GDP growth in 2011 is unlikely to bounce back to pre-global financial recession levels, when it stood at 7%. Despite the relatively high levels of economic growth over the past few years, living conditions for the average Egyptian remain poor.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":497800000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":218500000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":5.1,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":13.5,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":37.9,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":48.6,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":26100000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":32,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":17,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":51,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":9.7,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":20,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":3.9,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":27.6,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":34.4,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":18.4,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":46820000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":64190000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":80.5,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":12.8,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":8.5,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":11.98,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":37800000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":166200000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":145600000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":89950000000},"Agriculture - products":"cotton, rice, corn, wheat, beans, fruits, vegetables; cattle, water buffalo, sheep, goats","Industries":"textiles, food processing, tourism, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, hydrocarbons, construction, cement, metals, light manufactures","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":5.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":118400000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":104100000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":814000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":251000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":680500,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":683000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":89300,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":48450,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":4300000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":62700000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":42500000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":8550000000.000001,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":1656000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":270000000},"Exports":{"usd":25340000000},"Exports - commodities":"crude oil and petroleum products, cotton, textiles, metal products, chemicals, processed food","Exports - partners":"US 7.95%, Italy 7.26%, Spain 6.78%, India 6.69%, Saudi Arabia 5.53%, Syria 5.3%, France 4.39%, South Korea 4.27% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":46520000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery and equipment, foodstuffs, chemicals, wood products, fuels","Imports - partners":"US 9.92%, China 9.63%, Germany 6.98%, Italy 6.88%, Turkey 4.94% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":35720000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":30610000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":72410000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":4900000000},"Exchange rates":"Egyptian pounds (EGP) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"ei","name":"Ireland","region":"Europe","background":"Celtic tribes arrived on the island between 600-150 B.C.

Ireland was among the initial group of 12 EU nations that began circulating the euro on 1 January 2002. GDP growth averaged 6% in 1995-2007, but economic activity has dropped sharply since the onset of the world financial crisis, with GDP falling by over 3% in 2008, nearly 8% in 2009, and 1% in 2010. Ireland entered into a recession in 2008 for the first time in more than a decade, with the subsequent collapse of its domestic property and construction markets. Property prices rose more rapidly in Ireland in the decade up to 2007 than in any other developed economy. Since their 2007 peak, average house prices have fallen 50%. In the wake of the collapse of the construction sector and the downturn in consumer spending and business investment, the export sector, dominated by foreign multinationals, has become a key component of Ireland's economy. Agriculture, once the most important sector, is now dwarfed by industry and services. In 2008 the COWEN government moved to guarantee all bank deposits, recapitalize the banking system, and establish partly-public venture capital funds in response to the country's economic downturn. In 2009, in continued efforts to stabilize the banking sector, the Irish Government established the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) to acquire problem commercial property and development loans from Irish banks. Faced with sharply reduced revenues and a burgeoning budget deficit, the Irish Government introduced the first in a series of draconian budgets in 2009. In addition to across-the-board cuts in spending, the 2009 budget included wage reductions for all public servants. These measures were not sufficient. The budget deficit reached nearly 32% of GDP in 2010 because of additional government support for the banking sector. In late 2010, the COWEN Government agreed to a $112 billion loan package from the EU and IMF to help Dublin further increase the capitalization of its banking sector and avoid defaulting on its sovereign debt. The government also initiated a four-year austerity plan to cut an additional $20 billion from its budget.

A number of aid programs sponsored by the World Bank and the IMF have been cut off since 1993 because of corruption and mismanagement. The government has been widely criticized for its lack of transparency and misuse of oil revenues; however, in 2010, under Equatorial Guinea's candidacy in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, the government published oil revenue figures for the first time. Undeveloped natural resources include gold, zinc, diamonds, columbite-tantalite, and other base metals. Growth remained strong in 2008, when oil production peaked, but slowed in 2009-10, as the price of oil and the production level fell.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":23820000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":14490000000},"GDP - real growth rate":"-0.8% (2010 est.)","GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":2.2,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":93.9,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":3.8,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":195200,"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":22.3,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":"NA%","highest 10%:":"NA%"},"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":29.1,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":6739000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":6984000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":4.1,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":8.2,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":4.25,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":"NA%","Stock of narrow money":{"usd":1860000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":2207000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":1534000000},"Agriculture - products":"coffee, cocoa, rice, yams, cassava (tapioca), bananas, palm oil nuts; livestock; timber","Industries":"petroleum, natural gas, sawmilling","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":1.8,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":28000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":26040000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":346000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":1000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":362900,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":1114,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":1100000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":6670000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":1500000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":5170000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":36810000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-1.477 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":10240000000},"Exports - commodities":"petroleum products, timber","Exports - partners":"US 30.31%, China 12.54%, Japan 9.21%, Spain 7.5%, South Korea 7.01%, Taiwan 5.63%, Italy 5.38%, Netherlands 4.09% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":5743000000},"Imports - commodities":"petroleum sector equipment, other equipment, construction materials, vehicles","Imports - partners":"China 19.97%, US 17.28%, Spain 14.94%, France 9.49%, Cote d'Ivoire 6.34%, Italy 5.02% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":4086000000.0000005},"Debt - external":{"usd":832000000},"Exchange rates":"Cooperation Financiere en Afrique Centrale francs per US dollar -"}},{"id":"en","name":"Estonia","region":"Europe","background":"After centuries of Danish, Swedish, German, and Russian rule, Estonia attained independence in 1918.

Eritrea has a command economy under the control of the sole political party, the People's Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ). Like the economies of many African nations, a large share of the population - nearly 80% - is engaged in subsistence agriculture, but they produce only a small share of total output. Since the conclusion of the Ethiopian-Eritrea war in 2000, the government has maintained a firm grip on the economy, expanding the use of the military and party-owned businesses to complete Eritrea's development agenda. The government strictly controls the use of foreign currency by limiting access and availability. Few private enterprises remain in Eritrea. Eritrea's economy depends heavily on taxes paid by members of the diaspora. Erratic rainfall and the delayed demobilization of agriculturalists from the military continue to interfere with agricultural production, and Eritrea's recent harvests have been unable to meet the food needs of the country. The Government continues to place its hope for additional revenue on the development of several international mining projects. Despite difficulties for international companies in working with the Eritrean Government, a Canadian mining company signed a contract with the government in 2007 and began mineral extraction in 2010. Eritrea's economic future depends upon its ability to master social problems such as illiteracy, unemployment, and low skills, and more importantly, on the government's willingness to support a true market economy.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":3625000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":2117000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":2.2,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":11.8,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":20.4,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":67.7,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":1935000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":80,"unit":"%"},"industry and services:":{"quantity":20,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":"NA%","Population below poverty line":{"quantity":50,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":"NA%","highest 10%:":"NA%"},"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":10.3,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":463400000},"expenditures:":{"usd":920100000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":20,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":"NA%","Stock of narrow money":{"usd":1382000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":2872000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":2919000000},"Agriculture - products":"sorghum, lentils, vegetables, corn, cotton, tobacco, sisal; livestock, goats; fish","Industries":"food processing, beverages, clothing and textiles, light manufacturing, salt, cement","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":8,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":271000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":228000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":5000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":4790,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-212 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":25000000},"Exports - commodities":"livestock, sorghum, textiles, food, small manufactures","Exports - partners":"India 25.3%, Italy 20.7%, Sudan 14.1%, China 12.9%, France 5.5%, Saudi Arabia 5.4% (2008)","Imports":{"usd":738000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery, petroleum products, food, manufactured goods","Imports - partners":"Saudi Arabia 20.7%, India 13.6%, Italy 12.6%, China 9.9%, US 5.1%, Germany 4.6% (2008)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":104000000},"Debt - external":"$NA (31 December 2010 est.)","Exchange rates":"nakfa (ERN) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"es","name":"El Salvador","region":"Central America and Caribbean","background":"El Salvador achieved independence from Spain in 1821 and from the Central American Federation in 1839.

Remittances accounted for 16% of GDP in 2009, and about a third of all households receive these transfers. In 2006 El Salvador was the first country to ratify the Dominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR), which has bolstered the export of processed foods, sugar, and ethanol, and supported investment in the apparel sector amid increased Asian competition and the expiration of the Multi-Fiber Agreement in 2005. El Salvador has promoted an open trade and investment environment, and has embarked on a wave of privatizations extending to telecom, electricity distribution, banking, and pension funds. In late 2006, the government and the Millennium Challenge Corporation signed a five-year, $461 million compact to stimulate economic growth and reduce poverty in the country's northern region, the primary conflict zone during the civil war, through investments in education, public services, enterprise development, and transportation infrastructure. With the adoption of the US dollar as its currency in 2001, El Salvador lost control over monetary policy. Any counter-cyclical policy response to the downturn must be through fiscal policy, which is constrained by legislative requirements for a two-thirds majority to approve any international financing, and by already high levels of debt.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":43570000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":21700000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":0.7,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":11,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":29.1,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":59.9,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":2940000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":19,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":23,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":58,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":7,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":37.8,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":1,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":37,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":52.4,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":13.7,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":3894000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":4915000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":55,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":0.8,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":6.59,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":2534000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":9666000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":10010000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":4432000000},"Agriculture - products":"coffee, sugar, corn, rice, beans, oilseed, cotton, sorghum; beef, dairy products","Industries":"food processing, beverages, petroleum, chemicals, fertilizer, textiles, furniture, light metals","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":0.9,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":5445000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":4524000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":78700000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":208400000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":46000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":1927,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":46310,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-907 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":4377000000},"Exports - commodities":"offshore assembly exports, coffee, sugar, textiles and apparel, gold, ethanol, chemicals, electricity, iron and steel manufactures","Exports - partners":"US 43.86%, Guatemala 13.92%, Honduras 13.22%, Nicaragua 5.65% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":7980000000},"Imports - commodities":"raw materials, consumer goods, capital goods, fuels, foodstuffs, petroleum, electricity","Imports - partners":"US 29.79%, Mexico 10.26%, Guatemala 9.7%, China 4.5%, Honduras 4.4% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":2882000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":11450000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":7522000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":273000000},"Exchange rates":{}}},{"id":"et","name":"Ethiopia","region":"Africa","background":"Unique among African countries, the ancient Ethiopian monarchy maintained its freedom from colonial rule with the exception of a short-lived Italian occupation from 1936-41.

In November 2001, Ethiopia qualified for debt relief from the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, and in December 2005 the IMF forgave Ethiopia's debt. The global economic downturn led to balance of payments pressures, partially alleviated by recent emergency funding from the IMF. While GDP growth has remained high, per capita income is among the lowest in the world.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":86120000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":29720000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":8,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":42.9,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":13.7,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":43.4,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":37900000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":85,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":5,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":10,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":"NA%","Population below poverty line":{"quantity":38.7,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":4.1,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":25.6,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":30,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":25.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":4360000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":5098000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":39.3,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":7,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":"NA%","Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":8,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":4764000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":8247999999.999999},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":8661000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Agriculture - products":"cereals, pulses, coffee, oilseed, cotton, sugarcane, potatoes, qat, cut flowers; hides, cattle, sheep, goats; fish","Industries":"food processing, beverages, textiles, leather, chemicals, metals processing, cement","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":9.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":3460000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":3130000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":38000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":33590,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":430000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":24920000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-2.232 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":1729000000},"Exports - commodities":"coffee, qat, gold, leather products, live animals, oilseeds","Exports - partners":"China 10.87%, Germany 9.75%, Saudi Arabia 7.39%, US 7.21%, Netherlands 6.38%, Switzerland 5.33%, Sudan 4.35%, Belgium 4% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":7517000000},"Imports - commodities":"food and live animals, petroleum and petroleum products, chemicals, machinery, motor vehicles, cereals, textiles","Imports - partners":"China 14.73%, Saudi Arabia 8.41%, India 7.65%, US 4.3% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":1880000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":4288999999.9999995},"Exchange rates":"birr (ETB) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"ez","name":"Czech Republic","region":"Europe","background":"At the close of World War I, the Czechs and Slovaks of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire merged to form Czechoslovakia.

While the conservative, inward looking Czech financial system has remained relative healthy, the small, open, export-driven Czech economy remains very sensitive to changes in the economic performance of its main export markets, especially Germany. When Western Europe and Germany fell into recession in late 2008, demand for Czech goods plunged, leading to double digit drops in industrial production and exports. As a result, real GDP fell 4.1% in 2009, with most of the decline occurring during the first quarter. Real GDP, however, has slowly recovered with positive quarter-on-quarter growth starting in the second half of 2009 and continuing throughout 2010. The auto industry remains the largest single industry and, together with its suppliers, accounts for as much as 20% of Czech manufacturing. The Czech Republic produced more than a million cars for the first time in 2010, over 80% of which were exported. Foreign and domestic businesses alike voice concerns about corruption, especially in public procurement. Other long term challenges include dealing with a rapidly aging population, funding an unsustainable pension and health care system, and diversifying away from manufacturing and toward a more high-tech, services-based, knowledge economy.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":261300000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":192200000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":2.3,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":2.2,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":38.3,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":59.5,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":5370000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":3.1,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":38.6,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":58.3,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":7.1,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":1.5,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":"NA (2009)"},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":26,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":22.5,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":77900000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":87870000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":40,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1.5,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":0.25,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":3.9,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":96820000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":138600000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":119500000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":73100000000},"Agriculture - products":"wheat, potatoes, sugar beets, hops, fruit; pigs, poultry","Industries":"motor vehicles, metallurgy, machinery and equipment, glass, armaments","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":15.9,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":82250000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":53420000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":22230000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":8580000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":10970,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":207600,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":29670,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":219900,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":15000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":178000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":8164000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":1111000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":9683000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":3072000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-5.956 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":116500000000},"Exports - commodities":"machinery and transport equipment, raw materials and fuel, chemicals","Exports - partners":"Germany 31.7%, Slovakia 8.7%, Poland 6.2%, France 5.5%, UK 4.9%, Austria 4.7%, Italy 4.5% (2010 est.)","Imports":{"usd":109200000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery and transport equipment, raw materials and fuels, chemicals","Imports - partners":"Germany 25.6%, China 11.9%, Poland 6.5%, Russia 5.4%, Slovakia 5.2% (2010 est.)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":42340000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":86790000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":130400000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":14670000000},"Exchange rates":"koruny (CZK) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"fi","name":"Finland","region":"Europe","background":"Finland was a province and then a grand duchy under Sweden from the 12th to the 19th centuries, and an autonomous grand duchy of Russia after 1809.

Trade is important with exports accounting for over one third of GDP in recent years. Finland is strongly competitive in manufacturing - principally the wood, metals, engineering, telecommunications, and electronics industries. Finland excels in high-tech exports such as mobile phones. Except for timber and several minerals, Finland depends on imports of raw materials, energy, and some components for manufactured goods. Because of the climate, agricultural development is limited to maintaining self-sufficiency in basic products. Forestry, an important export earner, provides a secondary occupation for the rural population. Finland had been one of the best performing economies within the EU in recent years and its banks and financial markets avoided the worst of global financial crisis. However, the world slowdown hit exports and domestic demand hard in 2009, with Finland experiencing one of the deepest contractions in the euro zone. A recovery of exports, domestic trade, and household consumption stimulated economic growth in 2010. The recession left a deep mark on general government finances and the debt ratio, turning previously strong budget surpluses into deficits. Despite good growth prospects, general government finances will remain in deficit during the next few years. The great challenge of economic policy will be to implement a post-recession exit strategy in which measures supporting growth will be combined with general government adjustment measures. Longer-term, Finland must address a rapidly aging population and decreasing productivity that threaten competitiveness, fiscal sustainability, and economic growth.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":186000000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":239200000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":3.1,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":2.6,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":29.1,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":68.2,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":2680000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture and forestry:":{"quantity":4.9,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":16.7,"unit":"%"},"construction:":{"quantity":7.1,"unit":"%"},"commerce:":{"quantity":19.4,"unit":"%"},"finance, insurance, and business services:":{"quantity":12.8,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":8.4,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":3.6,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":24.7,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":26.8,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":18.7,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":66580000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":65330000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":45.4,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1.2,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":1.75,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":3.51,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":108000000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":160400000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":259200000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":91020000000},"Agriculture - products":"barley, wheat, sugar beets, potatoes; dairy cattle; fish","Industries":"metals and metal products, electronics, machinery and scientific instruments, shipbuilding, pulp and paper, foodstuffs, chemicals, textiles, clothing","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":6,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":77440000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":87250000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":3335000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":16110000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":8718,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":206200,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":130500,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":337900,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":"NA","Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":4288999999.9999995,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":4288999999.9999995,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":4696000000},"Exports":{"usd":73530000000},"Exports - commodities":"electrical and optical equipment, machinery, transport equipment, paper and pulp, chemicals, basic metals; timber","Exports - partners":"Germany 10.32%, Sweden 9.79%, Russia 9%, US 7.85%, Netherlands 5.9%, UK 5.24%, China 4.1% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":69110000000},"Imports - commodities":"foodstuffs, petroleum and petroleum products, chemicals, transport equipment, iron and steel, machinery, textile yarn and fabrics, grains","Imports - partners":"Russia 16.28%, Germany 15.76%, Sweden 14.65%, Netherlands 6.99%, China 5.29%, France 4.22% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":9128000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":370800000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":87990000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":122200000000},"Exchange rates":"euros (EUR) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"fj","name":"Fiji","region":"Australia-Oceania","background":"Fiji became independent in 1970 after nearly a century as a British colony. Democratic rule was interrupted by two military coups in 1987 caused by concern over a government perceived as dominated by the Indian community (descendants of contract laborers brought to the islands by the British in the 19th century). The coups and a 1990 constitution that cemented native Melanesian control of Fiji led to heavy Indian emigration; the population loss resulted in economic difficulties, but ensured that Melanesians became the majority. A new constitution enacted in 1997 was more equitable. Free and peaceful elections in 1999 resulted in a government led by an Indo-Fijian, but a civilian-led coup in May 2000 ushered in a prolonged period of political turmoil. Parliamentary elections held in August 2001 provided Fiji with a democratically elected government led by Prime Minister Laisenia QARASE. Re-elected in May 2006, QARASE was ousted in a December 2006 military coup led by Commodore Voreqe BAINIMARAMA, who initially appointed himself acting president but in January 2007 became interim prime minister. Since taking power BAINIMARAMA has neutralized his opponents, crippled Fiji's democratic institutions, and refused to hold elections.","geo":{"Location":"Oceania, island group in the South Pacific Ocean, about two-thirds of the way from Hawaii to New Zealand","Geographic coordinates":{"S":{"deg":18,"min":0},"E":{"deg":175,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total:":{"quantity":18274,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world:":"","land:":{"quantity":18274,"unit":"sq km"},"water:":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than New Jersey","Land boundaries":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":1129,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"Maritime claims":"measured from claimed archipelagic straight baselines","territorial sea:":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone:":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf:":"200 m depth or to the depth of exploitation;

Fiji's sugar has special access to European Union markets but will be harmed by the EU's decision to cut sugar subsidies. Sugar processing makes up one-third of industrial activity but is not efficient. Fiji's tourism industry was damaged by the December 2006 coup and is facing an uncertain recovery time. In 2007 tourist arrivals were down almost 6%, with substantial job losses in the service sector, and GDP dipped. The coup has created a difficult business climate. The EU has suspended all aid until the interim government takes steps toward new elections. Long-term problems include low investment, uncertain land ownership rights, and the government's inability to manage its budget. Overseas remittances from Fijians working in Kuwait and Iraq have decreased significantly.

In 1987, the government began selling fishing licenses to foreign trawlers operating within the Falkland Islands' exclusive fishing zone. These license fees total more than $40 million per year, which help support the island's health, education, and welfare system. Squid accounts for 75% of the fish taken. Dairy farming supports domestic consumption; crops furnish winter fodder. Foreign exchange earnings come from shipments of high-grade wool to the UK and the sale of postage stamps and coins. The islands are now self-financing except for defense. The British Geological Survey announced a 200-mile oil exploration zone around the islands in 1993, and early seismic surveys suggest substantial reserves capable of producing 500,000 barrels per day; to date, no exploitable site has been identified. An agreement between Argentina and the UK in 1995 seeks to defuse licensing and sovereignty conflicts that would dampen foreign interest in exploiting potential oil reserves. Political tensions between the UK and Argentina rose in early 2010 after a UK company began oil drilling activities in the waters around the Falkland Islands but abated somewhat when the drilling operation failed to discover commercially exploitable oil reserves. Tourism, especially eco-tourism, is increasing rapidly, with about 30,000 visitors in 2001. Another large source of income is interest paid on money the government has in the bank. The British military presence also provides a sizeable economic boost.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":105100000},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":105100000},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":95,"unit":"%"},"industry:":"NA%","services:":"NA% (1996)"},"Labor force":1724,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":95,"unit":"%"},"industry and services:":{"quantity":5,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":"NA%","Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":"NA%","highest 10%:":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":66200000},"expenditures:":{"usd":67900000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":3.6,"unit":"%"},"Agriculture - products":"fodder and vegetable crops; sheep, dairy products; fish, squid","Industries":"fish and wool processing; tourism","Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Electricity - production":{"quantity":16000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":14880000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":270.9,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Exports":{"usd":125000000},"Exports - commodities":"wool, hides, meat, fish, squid","Imports":{"usd":90000000},"Imports - commodities":"fuel, food and drink, building materials, clothing","Debt - external":"$NA","Exchange rates":"Falkland pounds (FKP) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"fm","name":"Micronesia, Federated States of","region":"Australia-Oceania","background":"In 1979 the Federated States of Micronesia, a UN Trust Territory under US administration, adopted a constitution.

The sector accounts for about 95% of exports and nearly half of GDP. In early 2008 the Faroese economy began to slow as a result of smaller catches and historically high oil prices that continue to trouble the economy. Reduced catches, especially of cod and haddock, have continued to strain the Faroese economy. GDP grew 0.5% in 2008-09. The slowdown in the Faroese economy followed a strong performance since the mid-1990s with annual growth rates averaging close to 6%, mostly a result of increased fish landings and salmon farming, and high export prices. Unemployment reached its lowest level in the first half of 2008, but increased to 3.9% in 2009 and is rising. The Faroese Home Rule Government produced increasing budget surpluses that helped to reduce the large public debt, most of it to Denmark. However, total dependence on fishing and salmon farming make the Faroese economy very vulnerable to fluctuations in world demand. In addition, budget surpluses turned to deficits in 2008-09, and the economy at both the country and local level is running large deficits. Initial discoveries of oil in the Faroese area give hope for eventual oil production, which may provide a foundation for a more diversified economy and less dependence on Danish economic assistance. Aided by an annual subsidy from Denmark amounting to about 6% of Faroese GDP, the Faroese have a standard of living almost equal to that of Denmark and Greenland.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":1590000000},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":2450000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":0.5,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":16,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":29,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":55,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":34680,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":10.2,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":20.5,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":69.2,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":3.9,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":"NA%","highest 10%:":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":1163000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":1139000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":"-1.1% (2009)","Agriculture - products":"milk, potatoes, vegetables; sheep; salmon, other fish","Industries":"fishing, fish processing, small ship repair and refurbishment, handicrafts","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":8,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":275800000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":264399999.99999997,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":5000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":4922,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Exports":{"usd":848000000},"Exports - commodities":"fish and fish products 94%, stamps, ships","Exports - partners":"Hungary 36.26%, Denmark 21.36%, UK 12.21%, Nigeria 7.72%, US 6.49%, Norway 5.46% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":983000000},"Imports - commodities":"consumer goods 36%, raw materials and semi-manufactures 32%, machinery and transport equipment 29%, fuels, fish, salt","Imports - partners":"Denmark 54.42%, Norway 20.76%, Sweden 4.79% (2009)","Debt - external":{"usd":68100000},"Exchange rates":"Danish kroner (DKK) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"fp","name":"French Polynesia","region":"Australia-Oceania","background":"The French annexed various Polynesian island groups during the 19th century.

The government has partially or fully privatized many large companies, banks, and insurers, and has ceded stakes in such leading firms as Air France, France Telecom, Renault, and Thales. It maintains a strong presence in some sectors, particularly power, public transport, and defense industries. With at least 75 million foreign tourists per year, France is the most visited country in the world and maintains the third largest income in the world from tourism. France's leaders remain committed to a capitalism in which they maintain social equity by means of laws, tax policies, and social spending that reduce income disparity and the impact of free markets on public health and welfare. France has weathered the global economic crisis better than most other big EU economies because of the relative resilience of domestic consumer spending, a large public sector, and less exposure to the downturn in global demand than in some other countries. Nonetheless, France's real GDP contracted 2.5% in 2009, but recovered somewhat in 2010, while the unemployment rate increased from 7.4% in 2008 to 9.5% in 2010. The government pursuit of aggressive stimulus and investment measures in response to the economic crisis, however, are contributing to a deterioration of France's public finances. The government budget deficit rose sharply from 3.4% of GDP in 2008 to 7.8% of GDP in 2010, while France's public debt rose from 68% of GDP to 84% over the same period. Paris is terminating stimulus measures, eliminating tax credits, and freezing most government spending to bring the budget deficit under the 3% euro-zone ceiling by 2013, and to highlight France's commitment to fiscal discipline at a time of intense financial market scrutiny of euro zone debt levels. President SARKOZY - who secured passage of pension reform in 2010 - is expected to seek passage of some tax reforms in 2011, but he may delay additional, more costly, reforms until after the 2012 election.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":2145000000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":2583000000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":1.5,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":1.8,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":19.2,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":79,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":28210000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":3.8,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":24.3,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":71.8,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":9.5,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":6.2,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":24.8,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":32.7,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":19.9,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":1241000000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":1441000000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":83.5,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1.5,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":1.75,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":7.46,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":858600000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":2292000000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":4319000000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":1972000000000},"Agriculture - products":"wheat, cereals, sugar beets, potatoes, wine grapes; beef, dairy products; fish","Industries":"machinery, chemicals, automobiles, metallurgy, aircraft, electronics; textiles, food processing; tourism","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":3.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":535700000000.00006,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":447200000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":58690000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":10680000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":70820,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":1875000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":597800,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":2386000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":101200000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":877000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":44840000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":1931000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":45850000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":7079000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-53.29 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":508700000000},"Exports - commodities":"machinery and transportation equipment, aircraft, plastics, chemicals, pharmaceutical products, iron and steel, beverages","Exports - partners":"Germany 15.88%, Italy 8.16%, Spain 7.8%, Belgium 7.44%, UK 7.04%, US 5.65%, Netherlands 3.99% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":577700000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery and equipment, vehicles, crude oil, aircraft, plastics, chemicals","Imports - partners":"Germany 19.41%, Belgium 11.61%, Italy 7.97%, Netherlands 7.15%, Spain 6.68%, UK 4.9%, US 4.72%, China 4.44% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":"$NA (31 December 2010 est.)","Debt - external":{"usd":4698000000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":1207000000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":1837000000000},"Exchange rates":"euros (EUR) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"fs","name":"French Southern and Antarctic Lands","region":"Antarctica","background":"In February 2007, the Iles Eparses became an integral part of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands (TAAF).

Gabon depended on timber and manganese until oil was discovered offshore in the early 1970s. The oil sector now accounts for more than 50% of GDP although the industry is in decline as fields pass their peak production. Gabon continues to face fluctuating prices for its oil, timber, and manganese exports and the global recession led to a GDP contraction of 1.4% in 2009. Despite the abundance of natural wealth, poor fiscal management hobbles the economy. In 1997, an IMF mission to Gabon criticized the government for overspending on off-budget items, overborrowing from the central bank, and slipping on its schedule for privatization and administrative reform. The rebound of oil prices from 1999 to 2008 helped growth, but drops in production have hampered Gabon from fully realizing potential gains. Gabon signed a 14-month Stand-By Arrangement with the IMF in May 2007, and later that year issued a $1 billion sovereign bond to buy back a sizable portion of its Paris Club debt.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":22480000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":13060000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":5.7,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":4.5,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":62.7,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":32.8,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":712000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":60,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":15,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":25,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":21,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":2.5,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":32.7,"unit":"%"}},"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":28.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":3557000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":2945000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":25.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":"-1.3% (2010 est.)","Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":4.25,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":"NA%","Stock of narrow money":{"usd":1835000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":2764000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":1074000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Agriculture - products":"cocoa, coffee, sugar, palm oil, rubber; cattle; okoume (a tropical softwood); fish","Industries":"petroleum extraction and refining; manganese, gold; chemicals, ship repair, food and beverages, textiles, lumbering and plywood, cement","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":4.8,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":1774000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":1446000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":241700,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":14000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":227300,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":4185,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":2000000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":90000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":90000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":28320000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":591000000},"Exports":{"usd":6803000000},"Exports - commodities":"crude oil 70%, timber, manganese, uranium","Exports - partners":"Russia 30.62%, US 16.56%, China 15.87%, France 4.28% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":2433000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery and equipment, foodstuffs, chemicals, construction materials","Imports - partners":"France 32.21%, US 7.92%, China 7.02%, Belgium 4.99%, Italy 4.81%, Cameroon 4.56%, Netherlands 4.35% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":2602000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":2374000000},"Exchange rates":"Cooperation Financiere en Afrique Centrale francs per US dollar -"}},{"id":"gg","name":"Georgia","region":"Middle East","background":"The region of present day Georgia contained the ancient kingdoms of Colchis and Kartli-Iberia. The area came under Roman influence in the first centuries A.D. and Christianity became the state religion in the 330s. Domination by Persians, Arabs, and Turks was followed by a Georgian golden age (11th-13th centuries) that was cut short by the Mongol invasion of 1236. Subsequently, the Ottoman and Persian empires competed for influence in the region. Georgia was absorbed into the Russian Empire in the 19th century. Independent for three years (1918-1921) following the Russian revolution, it was forcibly incorporated into the USSR until the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991. An attempt by the incumbent Georgian government to manipulate national legislative elections in November 2003 touched off widespread protests that led to the resignation of Eduard SHEVARDNADZE, president since 1995. New elections in early 2004 swept Mikheil SAAKASHVILI into power along with his United National Movement party. Progress on market reforms and democratization has been made in the years since independence, but this progress has been complicated by Russian assistance and support to the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. After a series of Russian and separatist provocations in summer 2008, Georgian military action in South Ossetia in early August led to a Russian military response that not only occupied the breakaway areas, but large portions of Georgia proper as well. Russian troops pulled back from most occupied Georgian territory, but in late August 2008 Russia unilaterally recognized the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. This action was strongly condemned by most of the world's nations and international organizations.","geo":{"Location":"Southwestern Asia, bordering the Black Sea, between Turkey and Russia, with a sliver of land north of the Caucasus extending into Europe","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":42,"min":0},"E":{"deg":43,"min":30}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total:":{"quantity":69700,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world:":"","land:":{"quantity":69700,"unit":"sq km"},"water:":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than South Carolina","Land boundaries":{"total:":{"quantity":1461,"unit":"km"},"border countries:":"Armenia 164 km, Azerbaijan 322 km, Russia 723 km, Turkey 252 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":310,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea:":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone:":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"}},"Climate":"warm and pleasant;

However, GDP growth slowed in 2008 following the August 2008 conflict with Russia, and turned negative in 2009 as foreign direct investment and workers' remittances declined in the wake of the global financial crisis, but rebounded in 2010. Georgia's main economic activities include the cultivation of agricultural products such as grapes, citrus fruits, and hazelnuts; mining of manganese and copper; and output of a small industrial sector producing alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, metals, machinery, aircraft and chemicals. Areas of recent improvement include growth in the construction, banking services, and mining sectors, but reduced availability of external investment and the slowing regional economy are emerging risks. The country imports nearly all its needed supplies of natural gas and oil products. It has sizeable hydropower capacity, a growing component of its energy supplies. Georgia has overcome the chronic energy shortages and gas supply interruptions of the past by renovating hydropower plants and by increasingly relying on natural gas imports from Azerbaijan instead of from Russia. The construction on the Baku-T'bilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline, the Baku-T'bilisi-Erzerum gas pipeline, and the Kars-Akhalkalaki Railroad are part of a strategy to capitalize on Georgia's strategic location between Europe and Asia and develop its role as a transit point for gas, oil and other goods. Georgia has historically suffered from a chronic failure to collect tax revenues; however, the government, since coming to power in 2004, has simplified the tax code, improved tax administration, increased tax enforcement, and cracked down on petty corruption. However, the economic downturn of 2008-09 eroded the tax base and led to a decline in the budget surplus and an increase in public borrowing needs. The country is pinning its hopes for renewed growth on a determined effort to continue to liberalize the economy by reducing regulation, taxes, and corruption in order to attract foreign investment, but the economy faces a more difficult investment climate both domestically and internationally.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":22440000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":11670000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":6.4,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":11,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":27.1,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":62,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":1918000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":55.6,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":8.9,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":35.5,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":16.4,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":31,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":1.9,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":30.6,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":40.8,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":14.5,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":3172000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":3915000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":5.7,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":8,"unit":"%"}},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":25.52,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":1175000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":2146000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":3243000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":733300000},"Agriculture - products":"citrus, grapes, tea, hazelnuts, vegetables; livestock","Industries":"steel, aircraft, machine tools, electrical appliances, mining (manganese and copper), chemicals, wood products, wine","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":4,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":7970000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":6902000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":628000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":430000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":994.9,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":13000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":1486,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":16590,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":35000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":8000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":1730000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":1720000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":8494999999.999999,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-1.404 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":2290000000},"Exports - commodities":"scrap metal, wine, mineral water, ores, vehicles, fruits and nuts","Exports - partners":"Turkey 17.87%, Azerbaijan 12.3%, Bulgaria 9.6%, Canada 8.78%, UK 7.49%, Ukraine 6.82%, Spain 5.27%, US 4.99% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":4828000000},"Imports - commodities":"fuels, vehicles, machinery and parts, grain and other foods, pharmaceuticals","Imports - partners":"Turkey 16.81%, Azerbaijan 9.72%, Ukraine 9.17%, Russia 7.39%, US 6.63%, Germany 6.22% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":2350000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":3381000000},"Exchange rates":"laris (GEL) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"gh","name":"Ghana","region":"Africa","background":"Formed from the merger of the British colony of the Gold Coast and the Togoland trust territory, Ghana in 1957 became the first sub-Saharan country in colonial Africa to gain its independence.

Oil production at Ghana's offshore Jubilee field began in mid-December and is expected to boost economic growth. Ghana signed a Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Compact in 2006, which aims to assist in transforming Ghana's agricultural sector. Ghana opted for debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) program in 2002, and is also benefiting from the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative that took effect in 2006. In 2009 Ghana signed a three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility with the IMF to improve macroeconomic stability, private sector competitiveness, human resource development, and good governance and civic responsibility. Sound macro-economic management along with high prices for gold and cocoa helped sustain GDP growth in 2008-10.

In a referendum held in 1967, Gibraltarians voted overwhelmingly to remain a British dependency. The subsequent granting of autonomy in 1969 by the UK led to Spain closing the border and severing all communication links. A series of talks were held by the UK and Spain between 1997 and 2002 on establishing temporary joint sovereignty over Gibraltar. In response to these talks, the Gibraltar Government called a referendum in late 2002 in which the majority of citizens voted overwhelmingly against any sharing of sovereignty with Spain. Since late 2004, tripartite talks among Spain, the UK, and Gibraltar have been held with the aim of cooperatively resolving problems that affect the local population, and work continues on cooperation agreements in areas such as taxation and financial services; communications and maritime security; policy, legal and customs services; environmental protection; and education and visa services. Throughout 2009, a dispute over Gibraltar's claim to territorial waters extending out three miles gave rise to periodic non-violent maritime confrontations between Spanish and UK naval patrols. A new noncolonial constitution came into effect in 2007, and the European Court of First Instance recognized Gibraltar's right to regulate its own tax regime in December 2008, but the UK retains responsibility for defense, foreign relations, internal security, and financial stability.","geo":{"Location":"Southwestern Europe, bordering the Strait of Gibraltar, which links the Mediterranean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean, on the southern coast of Spain","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":36,"min":8},"W":{"deg":5,"min":21}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total:":{"quantity":6.5,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world:":"","land:":{"quantity":6.5,"unit":"sq km"},"water:":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"more than 10 times the size of The National Mall in Washington, D.C.","Land boundaries":{"total:":{"quantity":1.2,"unit":"km"},"border countries:":"Spain 1.2 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":12,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea:":{"quantity":3,"unit":"nm"}},"Climate":"Mediterranean with mild winters and warm summers","Terrain":"a narrow coastal lowland borders the Rock of Gibraltar","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point:":"Mediterranean Sea 0 m","highest point:":"Rock of Gibraltar 426 m"},"Natural resources":"none","Land use":{"arable land:":{"quantity":0,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops:":{"quantity":0,"unit":"%"},"other:":{"quantity":100,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":"NA","Natural hazards":"NA","Environment - current issues":"limited natural freshwater resources: large concrete or natural rock water catchments collect rainwater (no longer used for drinking water) and adequate desalination plant","Geography - note":"strategic location on Strait of Gibraltar that links the North Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea"},"people":{"Population":28956,"Age structure":{"0-14 years:":{"quantity":20.4,"unit":"%"},"15-64 years:":{"quantity":65.8,"unit":"%"},"65 years and over:":"13.8% (male 1,934/female 2,062) (2011 est.)"},"Median age":{"total:":{"quantity":33.3,"unit":"years"},"male:":{"quantity":32.4,"unit":"years"},"female:":{"quantity":34.3,"unit":"years"}},"Population growth rate":{"quantity":0.273,"unit":"%"},"Birth rate":{"quantity":14.23,"unit":"births/1,000 population"},"Death rate":{"quantity":8.18,"unit":"deaths/1,000 population"},"Net migration rate":"-3.32 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2011 est.)","Urbanization":{"urban population:":{"quantity":100,"unit":"% of total population"},"rate of urbanization:":{"quantity":0.2,"unit":"% annual rate of change"}},"Sex ratio":{"at birth:":{"quantity":1.07,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"under 15 years:":{"quantity":1.06,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"15-64 years:":{"quantity":1.02,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"65 years and over:":{"quantity":0.93,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"total population:":{"quantity":1.01,"unit":"male(s)/female"}},"Infant mortality rate":{"total:":{"quantity":6.69,"unit":"deaths/1,000 live births"},"country comparison to the world:":"","male:":{"quantity":7.44,"unit":"deaths/1,000 live births"},"female:":{"quantity":5.87,"unit":"deaths/1,000 live births"}},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population:":{"quantity":78.68,"unit":"years"},"country comparison to the world:":"","male:":{"quantity":75.84,"unit":"years"},"female:":{"quantity":81.72,"unit":"years"}},"Total fertility rate":{"quantity":1.96,"unit":"children born/woman"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":"NA","HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":"NA","HIV/AIDS - deaths":"NA","Nationality":{"noun:":"Gibraltarian(s)","adjective:":"Gibraltar"},"Ethnic groups":"Spanish, Italian, English, Maltese, Portuguese, German, North Africans","Religions":"Roman Catholic 78.1%, Church of England 7%, other Christian 3.2%, Muslim 4%, Jewish 2.1%, Hindu 1.8%, other or unspecified 0.9%, none 2.9% (2001 census)","Languages":"English (used in schools and for official purposes), Spanish, Italian, Portuguese","Literacy":{"definition:":"NA","total population:":"above 80%","male:":"NA","female:":"NA"},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":"NA","Education expenditures":"NA"},"economy":{"Economy - overview":"Self-sufficient Gibraltar benefits from an extensive shipping trade, offshore banking, and its position as an international conference center.

In the 19th century, cacao eventually surpassed sugar as the main export crop; in the 20th century, nutmeg became the leading export. In 1967, Britain gave Grenada autonomy over its internal affairs. Full independence was attained in 1974 making Grenada one of the smallest independent countries in the Western Hemisphere. Grenada was seized by a Marxist military council on 19 October 1983. Six days later the island was invaded by US forces and those of six other Caribbean nations, which quickly captured the ringleaders and their hundreds of Cuban advisers.

Denmark, however, continues to exercise control of Greenland's foreign affairs, security, and financial policy in consultation with Greenland's Home Rule Government.","geo":{"Location":"Northern North America, island between the Arctic Ocean and the North Atlantic Ocean, northeast of Canada","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":72,"min":0},"W":{"deg":40,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total:":{"quantity":2166,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world:":"","land:":{"quantity":2166,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly more than three times the size of Texas","Land boundaries":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":44087,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea:":{"quantity":3,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive fishing zone:":"200 nm or agreed boundaries or median line","continental shelf:":"200 nm or agreed boundaries or median line"},"Climate":"arctic to subarctic; cool summers, cold winters","Terrain":"flat to gradually sloping icecap covers all but a narrow, mountainous, barren, rocky coast","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point:":"Atlantic Ocean 0 m","highest point:":"Gunnbjorn Fjeld 3,700 m"},"Natural resources":"coal, iron ore, lead, zinc, molybdenum, diamonds, gold, platinum, niobium, tantalite, uranium, fish, seals, whales, hydropower, possible oil and gas","Land use":{"arable land:":{"quantity":0,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops:":{"quantity":0,"unit":"%"},"other:":{"quantity":100,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":"NA","Natural hazards":"continuous permafrost over northern two-thirds of the island","Environment - current issues":"protection of the arctic environment; preservation of the Inuit traditional way of life, including whaling and seal hunting","Geography - note":"dominates North Atlantic Ocean between North America and Europe; sparse population confined to small settlements along coast; close to one-quarter of the population lives in the capital, Nuuk; world's second largest ice cap"},"people":{"Population":57670,"Age structure":{"0-14 years:":{"quantity":22.3,"unit":"%"},"15-64 years:":{"quantity":70.2,"unit":"%"},"65 years and over:":"7.6% (male 2,269/female 2,097) (2011 est.)"},"Median age":{"total:":{"quantity":33.6,"unit":"years"},"male:":{"quantity":35,"unit":"years"},"female:":{"quantity":32.1,"unit":"years"}},"Population growth rate":{"quantity":0.05,"unit":"%"},"Birth rate":{"quantity":14.6,"unit":"births/1,000 population"},"Death rate":{"quantity":8.12,"unit":"deaths/1,000 population"},"Net migration rate":"-5.98 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2011 est.)","Urbanization":{"urban population:":{"quantity":84,"unit":"% of total population"},"rate of urbanization:":{"quantity":0.3,"unit":"% annual rate of change"}},"Major cities - population":"NUUK (capital) 15,000 (2009)","Sex ratio":{"at birth:":{"quantity":1.051,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"under 15 years:":{"quantity":1.03,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"15-64 years:":{"quantity":1.15,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"65 years and over:":{"quantity":1.05,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"total population:":{"quantity":1.12,"unit":"male(s)/female"}},"Infant mortality rate":{"total:":{"quantity":10.05,"unit":"deaths/1,000 live births"},"country comparison to the world:":"","male:":{"quantity":11.47,"unit":"deaths/1,000 live births"},"female:":{"quantity":8.55,"unit":"deaths/1,000 live births"}},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population:":{"quantity":70.96,"unit":"years"},"country comparison to the world:":"","male:":{"quantity":68.33,"unit":"years"},"female:":{"quantity":73.74,"unit":"years"}},"Total fertility rate":{"quantity":2.13,"unit":"children born/woman"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":"NA","HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":100,"HIV/AIDS - deaths":"NA","Nationality":{"noun:":"Greenlander(s)","adjective:":"Greenlandic"},"Ethnic groups":"Inuit 89%, Danish and other 11% (2009)","Religions":"Evangelical Lutheran, traditional Inuit spiritual beliefs","Languages":"Greenlandic (East Inuit) (official), Danish (official), English","Literacy":{"definition:":"age 15 and over can read and write","total population:":{"quantity":100,"unit":"%"},"male:":{"quantity":100,"unit":"%"},"female:":{"quantity":100,"unit":"%"}},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":"NA","Education expenditures":"NA"},"economy":{"Economy - overview":"The economy remains critically dependent on exports of shrimp and fish and on a substantial subsidy - about $650 million in 2009 - from the Danish Government, which supplies nearly 60% of government revenues. The public sector, including publicly owned enterprises and the municipalities, plays the dominant role in Greenland's economy. Greenland's GDP contracted about 2% in 2009 as a result of the global economic slowdown. Budget surpluses turned to deficits beginning in 2007 and unemployment has risen. During the last decade the Greenland Home Rule Government (GHRG) pursued conservative fiscal and monetary policies, but public pressure has increased for better schools, health care and retirement systems. The Greenlandic economy has benefited from increasing catches and exports of shrimp, Greenland halibut and, more recently, crabs. Due to Greenland's continued dependence on exports of fish - which account for 82% of exports - the economy remains very sensitive to foreign developments. International consortia are increasingly active in exploring for hydrocarbon resources off Greenland's western coast, and international studies indicate the potential for oil and gas fields in northern and northeastern Greenland. In May 2007 a US aluminum producer concluded a memorandum of understanding with the Greenland Home Rule Government to build an aluminum smelter and a power generation facility, which takes advantage of Greenland's abundant hydropower potential. Within the area of mining, olivine sand continues to be produced and gold production has resumed in south Greenland. Tourism also offers another avenue of economic growth for Greenland, with increasing numbers of cruise lines now operating in Greenland's western and southern waters during the peak summer tourism season.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":1989000000},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":2029999999.9999998},"GDP - real growth rate":"-2% (2009 est.)","GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":4.9,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":31.9,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":63.2,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":28240,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":4.9,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":31.9,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":63.2,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":6.8,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":9.2,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":"NA%","highest 10%:":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":1470000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":1510000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":9.4,"unit":"%"},"Agriculture - products":"forage crops, garden and greenhouse vegetables; sheep, reindeer; fish","Industries":"fish processing (mainly shrimp and Greenland halibut); gold, niobium, tantalite, uranium, iron and diamond mining; handicrafts, hides and skins, small shipyards","Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Electricity - production":{"quantity":310300000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":285600000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":4000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":1183,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":5172,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Exports":{"usd":485000000},"Exports - commodities":"fish and fish products 72%, metals 10% (2008)","Exports - partners":"Denmark 61.13%, Japan 13.69%, China 6.15%, Sweden 5.21% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":867000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery and transport equipment, manufactured goods, food, petroleum products","Imports - partners":"Denmark 74.93%, Sweden 11.73%, Norway 2.29% (2009)","Debt - external":{"usd":58000000},"Exchange rates":"Danish kroner (DKK) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"gm","name":"Germany","region":"Europe","background":"As Europe's largest economy and second most populous nation (after Russia), Germany is a key member of the continent's economic, political, and defense organizations.

With the advent of the Cold War, two German states were formed in 1949: the western Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and the eastern German Democratic Republic (GDR). The democratic FRG embedded itself in key Western economic and security organizations, the EC, which became the EU, and NATO, while the Communist GDR was on the front line of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. The decline of the USSR and the end of the Cold War allowed for German unification in 1990. Since then, Germany has expended considerable funds to bring Eastern productivity and wages up to Western standards. In January 1999, Germany and 10 other EU countries introduced a common European exchange currency, the euro. In January 2011, Germany assumed a nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council for the 2011-12 term.","geo":{"Location":"Central Europe, bordering the Baltic Sea and the North Sea, between the Netherlands and Poland, south of Denmark","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":51,"min":0},"E":{"deg":9,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total:":{"quantity":357022,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world:":"","land:":{"quantity":348672,"unit":"sq km"},"water:":{"quantity":8350,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than Montana","Land boundaries":{"total:":{"quantity":3621,"unit":"km"},"border countries:":"Austria 784 km, Belgium 167 km, Czech Republic 646 km, Denmark 68 km, France 451 km, Luxembourg 138 km, Netherlands 577 km, Poland 456 km, Switzerland 334 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":2389,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea:":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone:":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf:":"200 m depth or to the depth of exploitation"},"Climate":"temperate and marine;

Like its western European neighbors, Germany faces significant demographic challenges to sustained long-term growth. Low fertility rates and declining net immigration are increasing pressure on the country's social welfare system and necessitate structural reforms. The modernization and integration of the eastern German economy - where unemployment can exceed 20% in some municipalities - continues to be a costly long-term process, with annual transfers from west to east amounting in 2008 alone to roughly $12 billion. Reforms launched by the government of Chancellor Gerhard SCHROEDER (1998-2005), deemed necessary to address chronically high unemployment and low average growth, contributed to strong growth in 2006 and 2007 and falling unemployment. These advances, as well as a government subsidized, reduced working hour scheme, help explain the relatively modest increase in unemployment during the 2008-09 recession - the deepest since World War II - and its decrease to 7.4%in 2010. GDP contracted 4.7% in 2009 but grew by 3.6% in 2010. In its annual projection for 2011, the Federal Government expects the upswing to continue, with GDP forecast to grow this year at a real rate of 2.3%. The recovery was attributable primarily to rebounding manufacturing orders and exports - increasingly outside the Euro Zone. Domestic demand, however, is becoming more significant driver of Germany's economic expansion. Stimulus and stabilization efforts initiated in 2008 and 2009 and tax cuts introduced in Chancellor Angela MERKEL's second term increased Germany's budget deficit to 3.5% in 2010. The Bundesbank expects the deficit to drop to about 2.5% in 2011, below the EU's 3% limit. A constitutional amendment approved in 2009 likewise limits the federal government to structural deficits of no more than 0.35% of GDP per annum as of 2016.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":2940000000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":3316000000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":3.5,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":0.8,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":27.9,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":71.3,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":43350000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":2.4,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":29.7,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":67.8,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":7.4,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":15.5,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":3.6,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":24,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":27,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":18,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":1396000000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":1516000000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":78.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1.1,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":1.75,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":4.96,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":1627000000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":4288000000000.0005},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":5200000000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":1298000000000},"Agriculture - products":"potatoes, wheat, barley, sugar beets, fruit, cabbages; cattle, pigs, poultry","Industries":"among the world's largest and most technologically advanced producers of iron, steel, coal, cement, chemicals, machinery, vehicles, machine tools, electronics, food and beverages, shipbuilding, textiles","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":9,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":593400000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":547299999999.99994,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":61700000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":41670000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":156800,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":2437000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":536600,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":2862000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":276000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":15290000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":96260000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":12640000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":94570000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":175600000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":162300000000},"Exports":{"usd":1337000000000},"Exports - commodities":"machinery, vehicles, chemicals, metals and manufactures, foodstuffs, textiles","Exports - partners":"France 10.2%, US 6.7%, Netherlands 6.7%, UK 6.6%, Italy 6.3%, Austria 6%, China 4.5%, Switzerland 4.4% (2009 est.)","Imports":{"usd":1120000000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery, vehicles, chemicals, foodstuffs, textiles, metals","Imports - partners":"Netherlands 8.5%, China 8.2%, France 8.2%, US 5.9%, Italy 5.9%, UK 4.9%, Belgium 4.3%, Austria 4.3%, Switzerland 4.2% (2009 est.)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":"$NA (31 December 2010 est.)","Debt - external":{"usd":4713000000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":1057000000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":1484000000000},"Exchange rates":"euros (EUR) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"gq","name":"Guam","region":"Australia-Oceania","background":"Guam was ceded to the US by Spain in 1898.

During the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, it gradually added neighboring islands and territories, most with Greek-speaking populations. In World War II, Greece was first invaded by Italy (1940) and subsequently occupied by Germany (1941-44); fighting endured in a protracted civil war between supporters of the king and other anti-Communists and Communist rebels. Following the latter's defeat in 1949, Greece joined NATO in 1952. In 1967, a group of military officers seized power, establishing a military dictatorship that suspended many political liberties and forced the king to flee the country. In 1974, democratic elections and a referendum created a parliamentary republic and abolished the monarchy. In 1981, Greece joined the EC (now the EU); it became the 12th member of the European Economic and Monetary Union in 2001. In 2010, the prospect of a Greek default on its euro-denominated debt created severe strains within the EMU and raised the question of whether a member country might voluntarily leave the common currency or be removed.","geo":{"Location":"Southern Europe, bordering the Aegean Sea, Ionian Sea, and the Mediterranean Sea, between Albania and Turkey","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":39,"min":0},"E":{"deg":22,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total:":{"quantity":131957,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world:":"","land:":{"quantity":130647,"unit":"sq km"},"water:":{"quantity":1310,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than Alabama","Land boundaries":{"total:":{"quantity":1228,"unit":"km"},"border countries:":"Albania 282 km, Bulgaria 494 km, Turkey 206 km, Macedonia 246 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":13676,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea:":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf:":"200 m depth or to the depth of exploitation"},"Climate":"temperate;

Tourism provides 15% of GDP. Immigrants make up nearly one-fifth of the work force, mainly in agricultural and unskilled jobs. Greece is a major beneficiary of EU aid, equal to about 3.3% of annual GDP. The Greek economy grew by nearly 4.0% per year between 2003 and 2007, due partly to infrastructural spending related to the 2004 Athens Olympic Games, and in part to an increased availability of credit, which has sustained record levels of consumer spending. But the economy went into recession in 2009 as a result of the world financial crisis, tightening credit conditions, and Athens' failure to address a growing budget deficit, which was triggered by falling state revenues, and increased government expenditures. The economy contracted by 2% in 2009, and 4.8% in 2010. Greece violated the EU's Growth and Stability Pact budget deficit criterion of no more than 3% of GDP from 2001 to 2006, but finally met that criterion in 2007-08, before exceeding it again in 2009, with the deficit reaching 15.4% of GDP. Austerity measures reduced the deficit to 9.4% of GDP in 2010. Public debt, inflation, and unemployment are above the euro-zone average while per capita income is below; unemployment rose to 12% in 2010. Eroding public finances, a credibility gap stemming from inaccurate and misreported statistics, and consistent underperformance on following through with reforms prompted major credit rating agencies in late 2009 to downgrade Greece's international debt rating, and has led the country into a financial crisis. Under intense pressure by the EU and international market participants, the government has adopted a medium-term austerity program that includes cutting government spending, reducing the size of the public sector, decreasing tax evasion, reforming the health care and pension systems, and improving competitiveness through structural reforms to the labor and product markets. Athens, however, faces long-term challenges to push through unpopular reforms in the face of often vocal opposition from the country's powerful labor unions and the general public. Greek labor unions are striking over new austerity measures, but the strikes so far have had a limited impact on the government's will to adopt reforms. An uptick in widespread unrest, however, could challenge the government's ability to implement reforms and meet budget targets, and could also lead to rioting or violence. In April 2010 a leading credit agency assigned Greek debt its lowest possible credit rating; in May, the International Monetary Fund and Eurozone governments provided Greece emergency short- and medium-term loans worth $147 billion so that the country could make debt repayments to creditors. In exchange for the largest bailout ever assembled, the government announced combined spending cuts and tax increases totaling $40 billion over three years, on top of the tough austerity measures already taken. Greece, however, struggled to boost revenues and cut spending to meet 2010 targets set by the EU and the IMF, especially after Eurostat - the EU's statistical office - revised upward Greece's deficit and debt numbers for 2009 and 2010. Greece's lenders are calling on Athens to step up efforts in 2011 to increase tax collection, shore up public enterprises, and rein in health spending, and are planning to give Greece more time to repay its EU-IMF loan. Greece responded by introducing major structural reforms, but investors still question whether Greece can sustain fiscal efforts in the face of a bleak economic outlook and public discontent.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":318100000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":305400000000},"GDP - real growth rate":"-4.5% (2010 est.)","GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":4,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":17.6,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":78.5,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":5050000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":12.4,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":22.4,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":65.1,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":12,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":20,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":2.5,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":26,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":33,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":14.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":114500000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":142900000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":144,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":4.5,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":1.75,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":8.59,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":152800000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":335900000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":419900000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":54720000000},"Agriculture - products":"wheat, corn, barley, sugar beets, olives, tomatoes, wine, tobacco, potatoes; beef, dairy products","Industries":"tourism, food and tobacco processing, textiles, chemicals, metal products; mining, petroleum","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":3.2,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":58790000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":58280000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":1962000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":7575000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":6779,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":414400,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":153000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":520900,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":10000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":9000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":3528000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":3556000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":991100000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-17.1 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":21140000000},"Exports - commodities":"food and beverages, manufactured goods, petroleum products, chemicals, textiles","Exports - partners":"Germany 11.11%, Italy 11.05%, Cyprus 7.28%, Bulgaria 6.74%, US 4.95%, UK 4.4%, Turkey 4.23% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":44900000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery, transport equipment, fuels, chemicals","Imports - partners":"Germany 13.73%, Italy 12.71%, China 7.08%, France 6.1%, Netherlands 6.02%, South Korea 5.68%, Belgium 4.34%, Spain 4.08% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":"$NA (31 December 2010 est.)","Debt - external":{"usd":532900000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":48100000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":38660000000},"Exchange rates":"euros (EUR) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"gt","name":"Guatemala","region":"Central America and Caribbean","background":"The Mayan civilization flourished in Guatemala and surrounding regions during the first millennium A.D.

The agricultural sector accounts for nearly 15% of GDP and half of the labor force; key agricultural exports include coffee, sugar, and bananas. The 1996 peace accords, which ended 36 years of civil war, removed a major obstacle to foreign investment, and since then Guatemala has pursued important reforms and macroeconomic stabilization. The Dominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) entered into force in July 2006 spurring increased investment and diversification of exports, with the largest increases in ethanol and non-traditional agricultural exports. While CAFTA-DR has helped improve the investment climate, concerns over security, the lack of skilled workers and poor infrastructure continue to hamper foreign direct investment. The distribution of income remains highly unequal with the richest 10% of the population accounting for more than 40% of Guatemala's overall consumption. More than half of the population is below the national poverty line and 15% lives in extreme poverty. Poverty among indigenous groups, which make up 38% of the population, averages 76% and extreme poverty rises to 28%. 43% of children under five are chronically malnourished, one of the highest malnutrition rates in the world. President COLOM entered into office with the promise to increase education, healthcare, and rural development, and in April 2008 he inaugurated a conditional cash transfer program, modeled after programs in Brazil and Mexico, that provide financial incentives for poor families to keep their children in school and get regular health check-ups. Given Guatemala's large expatriate community in the United States, it is the top remittance recipient in Central America, with inflows serving as a primary source of foreign income equivalent to nearly two-thirds of exports or one-tenth of GDP. Economic growth fell in 2009 as export demand from US and other Central American markets fell and foreign investment slowed amid the global recession, but the economy recovered gradually in 2010 and will likely return to more normal growth rates by 2012. President COLOM, in his last year in office, will likely face opposition to economic reform, particularly over a long-delayed tax reform and an IMF-recommended reform to strengthen the banking sector.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":70150000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":41470000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":2.6,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":13.3,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":24.4,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":62.3,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":4260000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":50,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":15,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":35,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":3.2,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":56.2,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":1.3,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":42.4,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":55.1,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":13.9,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":4897000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":6124000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":29.6,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":3.9,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":"NA%","Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":13.85,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":6600000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":25400000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":15580000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Agriculture - products":"sugarcane, corn, bananas, coffee, beans, cardamom; cattle, sheep, pigs, chickens","Industries":"sugar, textiles and clothing, furniture, chemicals, petroleum, metals, rubber, tourism","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":2.6,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":8425000000.000001,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":7115000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":131900000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":8109999.999999999,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":13530,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":79000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":21850,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":72440,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":83070000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":2960000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-1.345 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":8470000000.000001},"Exports - commodities":"coffee, sugar, petroleum, apparel, bananas, fruits and vegetables, cardamom","Exports - partners":"US 40.41%, El Salvador 11.2%, Honduras 8.48%, Mexico 5.86% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":12650000000},"Imports - commodities":"fuels, machinery and transport equipment, construction materials, grain, fertilizers, electricity","Imports - partners":"US 36.46%, Mexico 10.49%, China 5.88%, El Salvador 5.14% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":5709000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":17470000000},"Exchange rates":"quetzales (GTQ) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"gv","name":"Guinea","region":"Africa","background":"Guinea has had a history of authoritarian rule since gaining its independence from France in 1958.

History repeated itself in December 2008 when following President CONTE's death, Capt. Moussa Dadis CAMARA led a military coup, seizing power and suspending the constitution. His unwillingness to yield to domestic and international pressure to step down led to heightened political tensions that culminated in September 2009 when presidential guards opened fire on an opposition rally killing more than 150 people, and in early December 2009 when CAMARA was wounded in an assassination attempt and evacuated to Morocco and subsequently to Burkina Faso. A transitional government led by General Sekouba KONATE held democratic elections in 2010 and Alpha CONDE was elected president in the country's first free and fair elections since independence.\r\n\r\n","geo":{"Location":"Western Africa, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean, between Guinea-Bissau and Sierra Leone","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":11,"min":0},"W":{"deg":10,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total:":{"quantity":245857,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world:":"","land:":{"quantity":245717,"unit":"sq km"},"water:":{"quantity":140,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than Oregon","Land boundaries":{"total:":{"quantity":3399,"unit":"km"},"border countries:":"Cote d'Ivoire 610 km, Guinea-Bissau 386 km, Liberia 563 km, Mali 858 km, Senegal 330 km, Sierra Leone 652 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":320,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea:":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone:":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"}},"Climate":"generally hot and humid;

The country has almost half of the world's bauxite reserves and significant iron ore, gold, and diamond reserves. However, Guinea has been unable to profit from this potential, as rampant corruption, dilapidated electricity and other degraded infrastructure, and political uncertainty have drained investor confidence. In the time since a 2008 coup following the death of long-term President Lansana CONTE, international donors, including the G-8, the IMF, and the World Bank, have significantly curtailed their development programs. Throughout 2009, policies of the ruling military junta severely weakened the economy. The junta leaders spent and printed money at an accelerated rate, driving inflation and debt to perilously high levels. In early 2010, the junta collapsed and was replaced by a Transition Government, which ceded power in December 2010 to the country's first-ever democratically elected president, Alpha CONDE. International assistance and investment are expected to return to Guinea, but the levels will depend upon the ability of the new government to combat corruption and reform its banking system. IMF and World Bank programs will be especially critical as Guinea attempts to gain debt relief. Since the 2009 global economic downturn, the price and value of bauxite and alumina exports has steadily risen. Export levels will likely continue to grow as investor confidence returns. International investors have expressed keen interest in Guinea's vast iron ore reserves, which could further propel the country's growth.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":10810000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":4633000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":1.9,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":25.8,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":45.7,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":28.5,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":4392000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":76,"unit":"%"},"industry and services:":{"quantity":24,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":"NA%","Population below poverty line":{"quantity":47,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":1.9,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":41,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":38.1,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":14.6,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":574100000},"expenditures:":{"usd":875400000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":15,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":"NA%","Commercial bank prime lending rate":"NA%","Stock of narrow money":{"usd":496200000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":830000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":734400000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Agriculture - products":"rice, coffee, pineapples, palm kernels, cassava (tapioca), bananas, sweet potatoes; cattle, sheep, goats; timber","Industries":"bauxite, gold, diamonds, iron; alumina refining; light manufacturing, and agricultural processing","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"Electricity - production":{"quantity":850000000,"unit":"kWh"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":790500000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":9000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":8674,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-434 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":1468000000},"Exports - commodities":"bauxite, alumina, gold, diamonds, coffee, fish, agricultural products","Exports - partners":"India 19.68%, Spain 13.18%, Russia 7.24%, Germany 6.86%, Ireland 5.87%, US 5.71%, Ukraine 5.6% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":1551000000},"Imports - commodities":"petroleum products, metals, machinery, transport equipment, textiles, grain and other foodstuffs","Imports - partners":"China 8.67%, Netherlands 6.67%, France 4.33%, UK 4.22% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":"$NA (31 December 2010 est.)","Debt - external":{"usd":3072000000},"Exchange rates":"Guinean francs (GNF) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"gy","name":"Guyana","region":"South America","background":"Originally a Dutch colony in the 17th century, by 1815 Guyana had become a British possession.

The economy is heavily dependent upon the export of six commodities - sugar, gold, bauxite, shrimp, timber, and rice - which represent nearly 60% of the country's GDP and are highly susceptible to adverse weather conditions and fluctuations in commodity prices. Guyana's entrance into the Caricom Single Market and Economy (CSME) in January 2006 has broadened the country's export market, primarily in the raw materials sector. Economic recovery since a 2005 flood-related contraction was buoyed by increases in remittances and foreign direct investment in the sugar and rice industries as well as the mining sector. Chronic problems include a shortage of skilled labor and a deficient infrastructure. The government is juggling a sizable external debt against the urgent need for expanded public investment. In March 2007, the Inter-American Development Bank, Guyana's principal donor, canceled Guyana's nearly $470 million debt, equivalent to nearly 48% of GDP, which along with other Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) debt forgiveness brought the debt-to-GDP ratio down from 183% in 2006 to 120% in 2007. Guyana became heavily indebted as a result of the inward-looking, state-led development model pursued in the 1970s and 1980s. Growth slowed in 2009-10 as a result of the world recession. The slowdown in the domestic economy and lower import costs helped to narrow the country's current account deficit, despite generally lower earnings from exports.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":5379000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":2215000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":3.6,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":24.3,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":24.7,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":51,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":333900,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":"NA%","industry:":"NA%","services:":"NA%"},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":11,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":1.3,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":33.8,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":43.2,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":34.1,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":619500000},"expenditures:":{"usd":655700000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":57,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":6.8,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":6.75,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":14.54,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":386900000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":1303000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":754000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA (31 December 2009)","Agriculture - products":"sugarcane, rice, edible oils; shrimp, fish, beef, pork, poultry","Industries":"bauxite, sugar, rice milling, timber, textiles, gold mining","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":2.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":821000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":667000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":10000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":10550,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-311 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":814000000},"Exports - commodities":"sugar, gold, bauxite, alumina, rice, shrimp, molasses, rum, timber","Exports - partners":"Canada 27.52%, US 16.93%, UK 10.84%, Ukraine 5.54%, Netherlands 5%, Trinidad and Tobago 4.33%, Jamaica 4.12% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":1366000000},"Imports - commodities":"manufactures, machinery, petroleum, food","Imports - partners":"US 25.23%, Trinidad and Tobago 23.23%, Cuba 6.41%, China 6.05% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":506000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":804300000},"Exchange rates":"Guyanese dollars (GYD) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"gz","name":"Gaza Strip","region":"Middle East","background":"The September 1993 Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements provided for a transitional period of Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Under a series of agreements signed between May 1994 and September 1999, Israel transferred to the Palestinian Authority (PA) security and civilian responsibility for many Palestinian-populated areas of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Negotiations to determine the permanent status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip stalled following the outbreak of an intifada in September 2000. In April 2003, the Quartet (US, EU, UN, and Russia) presented a roadmap to a final settlement of the conflict by 2005 based on reciprocal steps by the two parties leading to two states, Israel and a democratic Palestine. Following Palestinian leader Yasir ARAFAT's death in late 2004, Mahmud ABBAS was elected PA president in January 2005. A month later, Israel and the PA agreed to the Sharm el-Sheikh Commitments in an effort to move the peace process forward. In September 2005, Israel unilaterally withdrew all its settlers and soldiers and dismantled its military facilities in the Gaza Strip and withdrew settlers and redeployed soldiers from four small northern West Bank settlements. Nonetheless, Israel still controls maritime, airspace, and most access to the Gaza Strip; and it enforces a restricted zone along the border inside Gaza. In January 2006, the Islamic Resistance Movement, HAMAS, won control of the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC). HAMAS took control of the PA government in March 2006, but President ABBAS had little success negotiating with HAMAS to present a political platform acceptable to the international community so as to lift economic sanctions on Palestinians. Violent clashes between Fatah and HAMAS supporters in the Gaza Strip in 2006 and early 2007 resulted in numerous Palestinian deaths and injuries. In February 2007, ABBAS and HAMAS Political Bureau Chief MISHAL signed the Mecca Agreement in Saudi Arabia that resulted in the formation of a Palestinian National Unity Government (NUG) headed by HAMAS member Ismail HANIYA. However, fighting continued in the Gaza Strip, and in June 2007, HAMAS militants succeeded in a violent takeover of all military and governmental institutions in the Gaza Strip. ABBAS dismissed the NUG and through a series of presidential decrees formed a PA government in the West Bank led by independent Salam FAYYAD. HAMAS rejected the NUG's dismissal, and despite multiple rounds of Egyptian-brokered reconciliation negotiations, the two groups have failed to bridge their differences. Late November 2007 through June 2008 witnessed a substantial increase in Israeli-Palestinian violence. An Egyptian-brokered truce in June 2008 between Israel and HAMAS brought about a five-month pause in hostilities, but spiraling end-of-year violence resulted in the deaths of an estimated 1,100 to 1,400 Palestinians and left tens of thousands of people homeless. International donors pledged $4.5 billion in aid to rebuild the Gaza Strip, but by the end of 2010 large-scale reconstruction had not begun.\r\n\r\n\r\n","geo":{"Location":"Middle East, bordering the Mediterranean Sea, between Egypt and Israel","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":31,"min":25},"E":{"deg":34,"min":20}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total:":{"quantity":360,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world:":"","land:":{"quantity":360,"unit":"sq km"},"water:":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly more than twice the size of Washington, DC","Land boundaries":{"total:":{"quantity":62,"unit":"km"},"border countries:":"Egypt 11 km, Israel 51 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":40,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":"Israeli-occupied with current status subject to the Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement; permanent status to be determined through further negotiation","Climate":"temperate, mild winters, dry and warm to hot summers","Terrain":"flat to rolling, sand- and dune-covered coastal plain","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point:":"Mediterranean Sea 0 m","highest point:":"Abu 'Awdah (Joz Abu 'Awdah) 105 m"},"Natural resources":"arable land, natural gas","Land use":{"arable land:":{"quantity":29,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops:":{"quantity":21,"unit":"%"},"other:":{"quantity":50,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":"180 sq km; note - includes West Bank (2008)","Natural hazards":"droughts","Environment - current issues":"desertification; salination of fresh water; sewage treatment; water-borne disease; soil degradation; depletion and contamination of underground water resources","Geography - note":"strategic strip of land along Mideast-North African trade routes has experienced an incredibly turbulent history; the town of Gaza itself has been besieged countless times in its history"},"people":{"Population":1657,"Age structure":{"0-14 years:":{"quantity":43.9,"unit":"%"},"15-64 years:":{"quantity":53.5,"unit":"%"},"65 years and over:":"2.6% (male 17,326/female 25,523) (2011 est.)"},"Median age":{"total:":{"quantity":17.7,"unit":"years"},"male:":{"quantity":17.5,"unit":"years"},"female:":{"quantity":17.9,"unit":"years"}},"Population growth rate":{"quantity":3.201,"unit":"%"},"Birth rate":{"quantity":35.3,"unit":"births/1,000 population"},"Death rate":{"quantity":3.29,"unit":"deaths/1,000 population"},"Net migration rate":{"quantity":0,"unit":"migrant(s)/1,000 population"},"Urbanization":{"urban population:":{"quantity":72,"unit":"% of total population"},"rate of urbanization:":{"quantity":3.3,"unit":"% annual rate of change"}},"Sex ratio":{"at birth:":{"quantity":1.06,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"under 15 years:":{"quantity":1.06,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"15-64 years:":{"quantity":1.05,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"65 years and over:":{"quantity":0.68,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"total population:":{"quantity":1.04,"unit":"male(s)/female"}},"Infant mortality rate":{"total:":{"quantity":17.12,"unit":"deaths/1,000 live births"},"country comparison to the world:":"","male:":{"quantity":18.25,"unit":"deaths/1,000 live births"},"female:":{"quantity":15.92,"unit":"deaths/1,000 live births"}},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population:":{"quantity":73.92,"unit":"years"},"country comparison to the world:":"","male:":{"quantity":72.27,"unit":"years"},"female:":{"quantity":75.68,"unit":"years"}},"Total fertility rate":{"quantity":4.74,"unit":"children born/woman"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":"NA","HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":"NA","HIV/AIDS - deaths":"NA","Nationality":{"noun:":"NA","adjective:":"NA"},"Ethnic groups":"Palestinian Arab","Religions":"Muslim (predominantly Sunni) 99.3%, Christian 0.7%","Languages":"Arabic, Hebrew (spoken by many Palestinians), English (widely understood)","Literacy":{"definition:":"age 15 and over can read and write","total population:":{"quantity":92.4,"unit":"%"},"male:":{"quantity":96.7,"unit":"%"},"female:":{"quantity":88,"unit":"%"}},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":{"total:":{"quantity":14,"unit":"years"},"male:":{"quantity":13,"unit":"years"},"female:":{"quantity":14,"unit":"years"}},"Education expenditures":"NA"},"economy":{"Economy - overview":"High population density, limited land and sea access, continuing isolation, and strict internal and external security controls have degraded economic conditions in the Gaza Strip - the smaller of the two areas in the Palestinian Territories.

The French colony, based on forestry and sugar-related industries, became one of the wealthiest in the Caribbean but only through the heavy importation of African slaves and considerable environmental degradation. In the late 18th century, Haiti's nearly half million slaves revolted under Toussaint L'OUVERTURE. After a prolonged struggle, Haiti became the first black republic to declare independence in 1804. The poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, Haiti has been plagued by political violence for most of its history. After an armed rebellion led to the forced resignation and exile of President Jean-Bertrand ARISTIDE in February 2004, an interim government took office to organize new elections under the auspices of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH). Continued violence and technical delays prompted repeated postponements, but Haiti finally did inaugurate a democratically elected president and parliament in May of 2006. A massive magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck Haiti in January 2010 with an epicenter about 15 km southwest of the capital, Port-au-Prince. An estimated 2 million people lived within the zone of heavy to moderate structural damage.

Poverty, corruption, and poor access to education for much of the population are among Haiti's most serious disadvantages. Over the longer term, Haiti needs to create jobs for its young workforce and to build institutional capacity. Haiti's economy suffered a severe setback when a 7.0 magnitude earthquake destroyed much of its capital city, Port-au-Prince, and neighboring areas in January 2010. Already the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere with 80% of the population living under the poverty line and 54% in abject poverty, the damage to Port-au-Prince caused the country's GDP to contract an estimated 5.1% in 2010. Two-thirds of all Haitians depend on the agricultural sector, mainly small-scale subsistence farming, and remain vulnerable to damage from frequent natural disasters, exacerbated by the country's widespread deforestation. US economic engagement under the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement (HOPE) Act, passed in December 2006, has boosted apparel exports and investment by providing duty-free access to the US. Congress voted in 2010 to extend the legislation until 2020 under the Haitian Economic Lift Act (HELP); the apparel sector accounts for three-quarters of Haitian exports and nearly one-tenth of GDP. Remittances are the primary source of foreign exchange, equaling nearly 20% of GDP and more than twice the earnings from exports. Haiti suffers from a lack of investment, partly because of limited infrastructure and a lack of security. In 2005, Haiti paid its arrears to the World Bank, paving the way for reengagement with the Bank. Haiti received debt forgiveness for over $1 billion through the Highly-Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative in mis-2009. The remainder of its outstanding external debt was cancelled by donor countries in early 2010 but has since risen to about $400 million. The government relies on formal international economic assistance for fiscal sustainability, with over half of its annual budget coming from outside sources.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":11480000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":6632000000},"GDP - real growth rate":"-5.1% (2010 est.)","GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":25,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":16,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":59,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":{"Labor force":4810000,"country comparison to the world:":""},"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":38.1,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":11.5,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":50.4,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":40.6,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":80,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":0.7,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":47.7,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":59.2,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":25,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":900000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":2600000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":4.7,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":8,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":970000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":3249000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":960100000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Agriculture - products":"coffee, mangoes, sugarcane, rice, corn, sorghum; wood","Industries":"textiles, sugar refining, flour milling, cement, light assembly based on imported parts","Industrial production growth rate":"-4.8% (2010 est.)","Electricity - production":{"quantity":650000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":309000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":"NA kWh (2010 est.)","Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":12000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":12280,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-781 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":530200000.00000006},"Exports - commodities":"apparel, manufactures, oils, cocoa, mangoes, coffee","Exports - partners":"US 79.76%, Dominican Republic 7.24%, Canada 2.96% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":2727000000},"Imports - commodities":"food, manufactured goods, machinery and transport equipment, fuels, raw materials","Imports - partners":"US 33.11%, Dominican Republic 23.53%, Netherlands Antilles 10.75%, China 5.36% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":1587000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":350000000},"Exchange rates":"gourdes (HTG) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"hk","name":"Hong Kong","region":"East & Southeast Asia","background":"Occupied by the UK in 1841, Hong Kong was formally ceded by China the following year; various adjacent lands were added later in the 19th century.

Hong Kong's open economy left it exposed to the global economic slowdown, but its increasing integration with China, through trade, tourism, and financial links, helped it recover more quickly than many observers anticipated. The Hong Kong government is promoting the Special Administrative Region (SAR) as the site for Chinese renminbi (RMB) internationalization. Hong Kong residents are allowed to establish RMB-denominated savings accounts; RMB-denominated corporate and Chinese government bonds have been issued in Hong Kong; and RMB trade settlement is allowed. The territory far exceeded the RMB conversion quota set by Beijing for trade settlements in 2010 due to the growth of earnings from exports to the mainland. RMB deposits grew to roughly 4.6% of total system deposits in Hong Kong by the end of 2010, an increase of over 392% since the beginning of the year. The government is pursuing efforts to introduce additional use of RMB in Hong Kong financial markets and is seeking to expand the RMB quota for 2011. The mainland has long been Hong Kong's largest trading partner, accounting for about half of Hong Kong's exports by value. Hong Kong's natural resources are limited, and food and raw materials must be imported. As a result of China's easing of travel restrictions, the number of mainland tourists to the territory has surged from 4.5 million in 2001 to 22.5 million in 2010, outnumbering visitors from all other countries combined. Hong Kong has also established itself as the premier stock market for Chinese firms seeking to list abroad. In 2010 mainland Chinese companies constituted about 19% of the firms listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and accounted for 62% of the Exchange's market capitalization. During the past decade, as Hong Kong's manufacturing industry moved to the mainland, its service industry has grown rapidly and in 2009 accounted for more than 90% of the territory's GDP. GDP growth averaged a strong 3.8% from 1989 to 2010. Hong Kong's GDP fell in 2009 as a result of the global financial crisis, but a recovery began in third quarter 2009, and the economy grew nearly 6.8% in 2010. The Hong Kong government adopted several temporary fiscal policy support measures in response to the crisis that it may discontinue if strong growth is sustained. Credit expansion and tight housing supply conditions caused Hong Kong property prices to rise rapidly in 2010, and some lower income segments of the population are increasingly unable to afford adequate housing. Hong Kong continues to link its currency closely to the US dollar, maintaining an arrangement established in 1983.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":325800000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":225000000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":6.8,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":0.1,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":7.6,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":92.3,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":3700000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"manufacturing:":{"quantity":4.7,"unit":"%"},"construction:":{"quantity":2.2,"unit":"%"},"wholesale and retail trade, restaurants, and hotels:":{"quantity":41.7,"unit":"%"},"financing, insurance, and real estate:":{"quantity":12,"unit":"%"},"transport and communications:":{"quantity":6.3,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":4.3,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":"NA%","highest 10%:":"NA%"},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":53.3,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":21.4,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":48100000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":38900000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":18.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":4.5,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":0.5,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":5,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":130400000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":914900000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":390100000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":2702000000000},"Agriculture - products":"fresh vegetables; poultry, pork; fish","Industries":"textiles, clothing, tourism, banking, shipping, electronics, plastics, toys, watches, clocks","Industrial production growth rate":"-0.3% (2010 est.)","Electricity - production":{"quantity":38230000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":42640000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":2230000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":12260000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":418200,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":10020,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":428200,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":3700000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":3700000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":18070000000},"Exports":{"usd":388600000000},"Exports - commodities":"electrical machinery and appliances, textiles, apparel, footwear, watches and clocks, toys, plastics, precious stones, printed material","Exports - partners":"China 51.2%, US 11.6%, Japan 4.4% (2009 est.)","Imports":{"usd":431400000000},"Imports - commodities":"raw materials and semi-manufactures, consumer goods, capital goods, foodstuffs, fuel (most is reexported)","Imports - partners":"China 46.4%, Japan 8.8%, Taiwan 6.5%, Singapore 6.5%, US 5.3% (2009 est.)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":268899999999.99997},"Debt - external":{"usd":750800000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":962200000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":873100000000},"Exchange rates":"Hong Kong dollars (HKD) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"hm","name":"Heard Island and McDonald Islands","region":"Antarctica","background":"These uninhabited, barren, sub-Antarctic islands were transferred from the UK to Australia in 1947.

The US-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) came into force in 2006 and has helped foster foreign direct investment, but physical and political insecurity, as well as crime and perceptions of corruption, may deter potential investors; about 70% of FDI is from US firms. The economy registered sluggish economic growth in 2010, insufficient to improve living standards for the nearly 60% of the population in poverty. The LOBO administration inherited a difficult fiscal position with off-budget debts accrued in previous administrations and government salaries nearly equivalent to tax collections. His government has displayed a commitment to improving tax collection and cutting expenditures, and attracting foreign investment. This enabled Tegucigalpa to secure an IMF Precautionary Stand-By agreement in October 2010. The IMF agreement has helped renew multilateral and bilateral donor confidence in Honduras following the ZELAYA administration's economic mismanagement and the 2009 coup.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":33630000000.000004},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":15350000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":2.8,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":12.4,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":26.9,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":60.8,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":3394000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":39.2,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":20.9,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":39.8,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":5.1,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":65,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":0.7,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":42.2,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":53.8,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":23.3,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":2923000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":3651000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":26.1,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":4.6,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":"NA%","Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":19.16,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":1296000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":7618000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":7581000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Agriculture - products":"bananas, coffee, citrus, corn, African palm; beef; timber; shrimp, tilapia, lobster","Industries":"sugar, coffee, woven and knit apparel, wood products, cigars","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":2.4,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":6580000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":6540000000,"unit":"kWh"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":11800000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":56000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":46130,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-1.048 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":5879000000},"Exports - commodities":"apparel, coffee, shrimp, wire harnesses, cigars, bananas, gold, palm oil, fruit, lobster, lumber","Exports - partners":"US 59.6%, El Salvador 5.61%, Guatemala 5.28%, Mexico 4.19%, Germany 4.04% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":8878000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery and transport equipment, industrial raw materials, chemical products, fuels, foodstuffs","Imports - partners":"US 46.81%, Guatemala 8.92%, El Salvador 7.13%, Mexico 5.54%, Costa Rica 4.91% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":2302000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":3540000000},"Exchange rates":"lempiras (HNL) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"hr","name":"Croatia","region":"Europe","background":"The lands that today comprise Croatia were part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until the close of World War I.

Between 2000 and 2007, however, Croatia's economic fortunes began to improve slowly, with moderate but steady GDP growth between 4% and 6% led by a rebound in tourism and credit-driven consumer spending. Inflation over the same period has remained tame and the currency, the kuna, stable. Nevertheless, difficult problems still remain, including a stubbornly high unemployment rate, a growing trade deficit and uneven regional development. The state retains a large role in the economy, as privatization efforts often meet stiff public and political resistance. While macroeconomic stabilization has largely been achieved, structural reforms lag because of deep resistance on the part of the public and lack of strong support from politicians. The EU accession process should accelerate fiscal and structural reform. While long term growth prospects for the economy remain strong, Croatia will face significant pressure as a result of the global financial crisis. Croatia's high foreign debt, anemic export sector, strained state budget, and over-reliance on tourism revenue will result in higher risk to economic stability over the medium term.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":78090000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":60590000000},"GDP - real growth rate":"-1.4% (2010 est.)","GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":6.8,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":27.2,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":66,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":1762000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":5,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":31.3,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":63.6,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":17.6,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":17,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":3.6,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":23.1,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":29,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":22.4,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":22000000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":24290000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":55,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1.3,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":9,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":11.55,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":8720000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":40800000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":48620000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":25640000000},"Agriculture - products":"wheat, corn, sugar beets, sunflower seed, barley, alfalfa, clover, olives, citrus, grapes, soybeans, potatoes; livestock, dairy products","Industries":"chemicals and plastics, machine tools, fabricated metal, electronics, pig iron and rolled steel products, aluminum, paper, wood products, construction materials, textiles, shipbuilding, petroleum and petroleum refining, food and beverages, tourism","Industrial production growth rate":"-0.9% (2010 est.)","Electricity - production":{"quantity":11490000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":18000000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":5668000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":12240000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":23960,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":106000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":43750,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":122100,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":73350000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":2847000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":3205000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":695500000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":1220000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":30580000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-2.312 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":11510000000},"Exports - commodities":"transport equipment, machinery, textiles, chemicals, foodstuffs, fuels","Exports - partners":"Italy 19.1%, Bosnia and Herzegovina 12.98%, Germany 11.06%, Slovenia 7.47%, Austria 5.44%, Serbia 5.41% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":20930000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery, transport and electrical equipment; chemicals, fuels and lubricants; foodstuffs","Imports - partners":"Italy 15.46%, Germany 13.57%, Russia 9.29%, China 6.83%, Slovenia 5.75%, Austria 5.04% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":13790000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":59700000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":34630000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":6334000000},"Exchange rates":"kuna (HRK) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"hu","name":"Hungary","region":"Europe","background":"Hungary became a Christian kingdom in A.D. 1000 and for many centuries served as a bulwark against Ottoman Turkish expansion in Europe.

The private sector accounts for more than 80% of GDP. Foreign ownership of and investment in Hungarian firms are widespread, with cumulative foreign direct investment worth more than $70 billion. The government's austerity measures, imposed since late 2006, have reduced the budget deficit from over 9% of GDP in 2006 to 3.2% in 2010, with a target of less than 3% in 2011. Hungary's impending inability to service its short-term debt - brought on by the global financial crisis in late 2008 - led Budapest to obtain an IMF/EU/World Bank-arranged financial assistance package worth over $25 billion. The global economic downturn, declining exports, and low domestic consumption and fixed asset accumulation, dampened by government austerity measures, resulted in an economic contraction of 6.3% in 2009. In 2010 the new government implemented a number of changes including cutting business and personal income taxes, but imposed \"crisis taxes\" on financial institutions, energy and telecom companies, and retailers. The economy rebounded in 2010 with a big boost from exports, especially to Germany, and growth of more than 2.5% is expected in 2011.

Prior to the 2008 crisis, Iceland had achieved high growth, low unemployment, and a remarkably even distribution of income. The economy depends heavily on the fishing industry, which provides 40% of export earnings, more than 12% of GDP, and employs 7% of the work force. It remains sensitive to declining fish stocks as well as to fluctuations in world prices for its main exports: fish and fish products, aluminum, and ferrosilicon. Iceland's economy has been diversifying into manufacturing and service industries in the last decade, particularly within the fields of software production, biotechnology, and tourism. Abundant geothermal and hydropower sources have attracted substantial foreign investment in the aluminum sector and boosted economic growth, although the financial crisis has put several investment projects on hold. Much of Iceland's economic growth in recent years came as the result of a boom in domestic demand following the rapid expansion of the country's financial sector. Domestic banks expanded aggressively in foreign markets, and consumers and businesses borrowed heavily in foreign currencies, following the privatization of the banking sector in the early 2000s. Worsening global financial conditions throughout 2008 resulted in a sharp depreciation of the krona vis-a-vis other major currencies. The foreign exposure of Icelandic banks, whose loans and other assets totaled more than 10 times the country's GDP, became unsustainable. Iceland's three largest banks collapsed in late 2008. The country secured over $10 billion in loans from the IMF and other countries to stabilize its currency and financial sector, and to back government guarantees for foreign deposits in Icelandic banks. GDP fell 6.8% in 2009, and unemployment peaked at 9.4% in February 2009. GDP fell 3.4% in 2010. Since the collapse of Iceland's financial sector, government economic priorities have included: stabilizing the krona, reducing Iceland's high budget deficit, containing inflation, restructuring the financial sector, and diversifying the economy. Three new banks were established to take over the domestic assets of the collapsed banks. Two of them have foreign majority ownership, while the State holds a majority of the shares of the third. British and Dutch authorities have pressed claims totaling over $5 billion against Iceland to compensate their citizens for losses suffered on deposits held in the failed Icelandic bank, Landsbanki Islands. Iceland agreed to new terms with the UK and the Netherlands to compensate British and Dutch depositors, but the agreement must first be approved by the Icelandic President. Iceland began accession negotiations with the EU in July 2010; however, public support has dropped substantially because of concern about losing control over fishing resources and in reaction to measures taken by Brussels during the ongoing Eurozone crisis.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":11820000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":12590000000},"GDP - real growth rate":"-3.5% (2010 est.)","GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":5.5,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":24.7,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":69.9,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":178800,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":4.8,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":22.2,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":73,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":8.3,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":"NA%","highest 10%:":"NA%"},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":28,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":12.4,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":4810000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":5673000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":123.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":5.5,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":14.55,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":18.99,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":4413000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":19970000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":46030000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":1128000000},"Agriculture - products":"potatoes, green vegetables; mutton, chicken, pork, beef, dairy products; fish","Industries":"fish processing; aluminum smelting, ferrosilicon production; geothermal power, hydropower, tourism","Industrial production growth rate":"-1% (2010 est.)","Electricity - production":{"quantity":16840000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":16480000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":18900,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":1915,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":16390,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-42 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":4619000000},"Exports - commodities":"fish and fish products 40%, aluminum, animal products, ferrosilicon, diatomite","Exports - partners":"Netherlands 30.71%, UK 12.73%, Germany 11.21%, Norway 5.75%, Spain 4.82% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":3677000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery and equipment, petroleum products, foodstuffs, textiles","Imports - partners":"Norway 12.97%, Netherlands 8.62%, Germany 8.3%, Sweden 8.03%, Denmark 7.27%, US 6.94%, China 4.98%, UK 4.55%, Brazil 4.09% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":4206000000.0000005},"Debt - external":{"usd":3073000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":"$NA (31 December 2010)","Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA","Exchange rates":"Icelandic kronur (ISK) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"id","name":"Indonesia","region":"East & Southeast Asia","background":"The Dutch began to colonize Indonesia in the early 17th century; Japan occupied the islands from 1942 to 1945.

Increasing investment by both local and foreign investors is also supporting solid growth. Although the economy slowed to 4.5% growth in 2009 from the 6%-plus growth rate recorded in 2007 and 2008, by 2010 growth returned to a 6% rate. During the recession, Indonesia outperformed most of its regional neighbors. The government made economic advances under the first administration of President YUDHOYONO, introducing significant reforms in the financial sector, including tax and customs reforms, the use of Treasury bills, and capital market development and supervision. Indonesia's debt-to-GDP ratio in recent years has declined steadily because of increasingly robust GDP growth and sound fiscal stewardship, leading two of the three leading credit agencies to upgrade credit ratings for Indonesia's sovereign debt to one notch below investment grade. Indonesia still struggles with poverty and unemployment, inadequate infrastructure, corruption, a complex regulatory environment, and unequal resource distribution among regions. YUDHOYONO and his vice president, respected economist BOEDIONO, have maintained broad continuity of economic policy, although the economic reform agenda has been slowed during the first year of their term by corruption scandals and the departure of an internationally respected finance minister. In late 2010, increasing inflation, driven by higher and volatile food prices, posed an increasing challenge to economic policymakers and threatened to push millions of the near-poor below the poverty line. The government in 2011 faces the ongoing challenge of improving Indonesia's infrastructure to remove impediments to growth, while addressing climate change concerns, particularly with regard to conserving Indonesia's forests and peatlands, the focus of a potentially trailblazing $1 billion REDD+ pilot project.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":1030000000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":706700000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":6.1,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":16.5,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":46.4,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":37.1,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":116500000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":38.3,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":12.8,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":48.9,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":7.1,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":13.33,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":32.3,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":37,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":32.5,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":119500000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":132900000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":26.4,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":5.1,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":6.37,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":13.29,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":62270000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":243100000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":253100000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":361200000000},"Agriculture - products":"rice, cassava (tapioca), peanuts, rubber, cocoa, coffee, palm oil, copra; poultry, beef, pork, eggs","Industries":"petroleum and natural gas, textiles, apparel, footwear, mining, cement, chemical fertilizers, plywood, rubber, food, tourism","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":3.6,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":129000000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":119300000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":1022999.9999999999,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":1115000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":322000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":456700,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":4050000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":85700000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":45200000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":33500000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":3001000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":8532000000},"Exports":{"usd":146300000000},"Exports - commodities":"oil and gas, electrical appliances, plywood, textiles, rubber","Exports - partners":"Japan 17.28%, Singapore 11.29%, US 10.81%, China 7.62%, South Korea 5.53%, India 4.35%, Taiwan 4.11%, Malaysia 4.07% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":111100000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery and equipment, chemicals, fuels, foodstuffs","Imports - partners":"Singapore 24.96%, China 12.52%, Japan 8.92%, Malaysia 5.88%, South Korea 5.64%, US 4.88%, Thailand 4.45% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":96210000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":196100000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":81210000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":33710000000},"Exchange rates":"Indonesian rupiah (IDR) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"im","name":"Isle of Man","region":"Europe","background":"Part of the Norwegian Kingdom of the Hebrides until the 13th century when it was ceded to Scotland, the isle came under the British crown in 1765.

Aryan tribes from the northwest infiltrated onto the Indian subcontinent about 1500 B.C.; their merger with the earlier Dravidian inhabitants created the classical Indian culture. The Maurya Empire of the 4th and 3rd centuries B.C. - which reached its zenith under ASHOKA - united much of South Asia. The Golden Age ushered in by the Gupta dynasty (4th to 6th centuries A.D.) saw a flowering of Indian science, art, and culture. Islam spread across the subcontinent over a period of 700 years. In the 10th and 11th centuries, Turks and Afghans invaded India and established the Delhi Sultanate. In the early 16th century, the Emperor BABUR established the Mughal Dynasty which ruled India for more than three centuries. European explorers began establishing footholds in India during the 16th century. By the 19th century, Great Britain had become the dominant political power on the subcontinent. The British Indian Army played a vital role in both World Wars. Nonviolent resistance to British rule, led by Mohandas GANDHI and Jawaharlal NEHRU, eventually brought about independence in 1947. Communal violence led to the subcontinent's bloody partition, which resulted in the creation of two separate states, India and Pakistan. The two countries have fought three wars since independence, the last of which in 1971 resulted in East Pakistan becoming the separate nation of Bangladesh. India's nuclear weapons tests in 1998 caused Pakistan to conduct its own tests that same year. In November 2008, terrorists allegedly originating from Pakistan conducted a series of coordinated attacks in Mumbai, India's financial capital. Despite pressing problems such as significant overpopulation, environmental degradation, extensive poverty, and widespread corruption, rapid economic development is fueling India's rise on the world stage. In January 2011, India assumed a nonpermanent seat in the UN Security Council for the 2011-12 term.","geo":{"Location":"Southern Asia, bordering the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, between Burma and Pakistan","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":20,"min":0},"E":{"deg":77,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total:":{"quantity":3287,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world:":"","land:":{"quantity":2973,"unit":"sq km"},"water:":{"quantity":314070,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly more than one-third the size of the US","Land boundaries":{"total:":{"quantity":14103,"unit":"km"},"border countries:":"Bangladesh 4,053 km, Bhutan 605 km, Burma 1,463 km, China 3,380 km, Nepal 1,690 km, Pakistan 2,912 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":7000,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea:":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone:":{"quantity":24,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone:":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf:":"200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin"},"Climate":"varies from tropical monsoon in south to temperate in north","Terrain":"upland plain (Deccan Plateau) in south, flat to rolling plain along the Ganges, deserts in west, Himalayas in north","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point:":"Indian Ocean 0 m","highest point:":"Kanchenjunga 8,598 m"},"Natural resources":"coal (fourth-largest reserves in the world), iron ore, manganese, mica, bauxite, rare earth elements, titanium ore, chromite, natural gas, diamonds, petroleum, limestone, arable land","Land use":{"arable land:":{"quantity":48.83,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops:":{"quantity":2.8,"unit":"%"},"other:":{"quantity":48.37,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":622860,"unit":"sq km"},"Total renewable water resources":{"quantity":1907.8,"unit":"cu km"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total:":{"quantity":645.84,"unit":"cu km/yr"},"per capita:":{"quantity":585,"unit":"cu m/yr"}},"Natural hazards":{"Natural hazards":"droughts;

Economic liberalization, including industrial deregulation, privatization of state-owned enterprises, and reduced controls on foreign trade and investment, began in the early 1990s and has served to accelerate the country's growth, which has averaged more than 7% per year since 1997. India's diverse economy encompasses traditional village farming, modern agriculture, handicrafts, a wide range of modern industries, and a multitude of services. Slightly more than half of the work force is in agriculture, but services are the major source of economic growth, accounting for more than half of India's output, with only one-third of its labor force. India has capitalized on its large educated English-speaking population to become a major exporter of information technology services and software workers. In 2010, the Indian economy rebounded robustly from the global financial crisis - in large part because of strong domestic demand - and growth exceeded 8% year-on-year in real terms. Merchandise exports, which account for about 15% of GDP, returned to pre-financial crisis levels. An industrial expansion and high food prices, resulting from the combined effects of the weak 2009 monsoon and inefficiencies in the government's food distribution system, fueled inflation which peaked at about 11% in the first half of 2010, but has gradually decreased to single digits following a series of central bank interest rate hikes. In 2010 New Delhi reduced subsidies for fuel and fertilizers, sold a small percentage of its shares in some state-owned enterprises and auctioned off rights to radio bandwidth for 3G telecommunications in part to lower the government's deficit. The Indian Government seeks to reduce its budget deficit to 5.5% of GDP in FY 2010-11, down from 6.8% in the previous fiscal year. India's long term challenges include widespread poverty, inadequate physical and social infrastructure, limited non-agricultural employment opportunities, insufficient access to quality basic and higher education, and accommodating rural-to-urban migration.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":4059999999999.9995},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":1538000000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":10.4,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":16.1,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":28.6,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":55.3,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":478300000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":52,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":14,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":34,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":10.8,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":25,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":3.6,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":31.1,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":36.8,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":32,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":170700000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":268000000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":55.9,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":11.7,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":6,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":12.19,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":328400000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":1290000000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":1164000000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":1179000000000},"Agriculture - products":"rice, wheat, oilseed, cotton, jute, tea, sugarcane, lentils, onions, potatoes; dairy products, sheep, goats, poultry; fish","Industries":"textiles, chemicals, food processing, steel, transportation equipment, cement, mining, petroleum, machinery, software, pharmaceuticals","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":9.7,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":723800000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":568000000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":810000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":5270000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":878700,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":2980000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":738600,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":2900000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":5800000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":38650000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":51270000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":12620000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":1075000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-26.91 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":201000000000},"Exports - commodities":"petroleum products, precious stones, machinery, iron and steel, chemicals, vehicles, apparel","Exports - partners":"UAE 12.87%, US 12.59%, China 5.59% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":327000000000},"Imports - commodities":"crude oil, precious stones, machinery, fertilizer, iron and steel, chemicals","Imports - partners":"China 10.94%, US 7.16%, Saudi Arabia 5.36%, UAE 5.18%, Australia 5.02%, Germany 4.86%, Singapore 4.02% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":284100000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":237100000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":191100000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":89040000000},"Exchange rates":"Indian rupees (INR) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"io","name":"British Indian Ocean Territory","region":"South Asia","background":"Formerly administered as part of the British Crown Colony of Mauritius, the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) was established as an overseas territory of the UK in 1965. A number of the islands of the territory were later transferred to the Seychelles when it attained independence in 1976. Subsequently, BIOT has consisted only of the six main island groups comprising the Chagos Archipelago. The largest and most southerly of the islands, Diego Garcia, contains a joint UK-US naval support facility. All of the remaining islands are uninhabited. Between 1967 and 1973, former agricultural workers, earlier residents in the islands, were relocated primarily to Mauritius, but also to the Seychelles. Negotiations between 1971 and 1982 resulted in the establishment of a trust fund by the British Government as compensation for the displaced islanders, known as Chagossians. Beginning in 1998, the islanders pursued a series of lawsuits against the British Government seeking further compensation and the right to return to the territory. In 2006 and 2007, British court rulings invalidated the immigration policies contained in the 2004 BIOT Constitution Order that had excluded the islanders from the archipelago, but upheld the special military status of Diego Garcia. In 2008, the House of Lords, as the final court of appeal in the UK, ruled in favor of the British Government by overturning the lower court rulings and finding no right of return for the Chagossians.","geo":{"Location":"archipelago in the Indian Ocean, south of India, about halfway between Africa and Indonesia","Geographic coordinates":"6 00 S, 71 30 E; note - Diego Garcia 7 20 S, 72 25 E","Map references":{},"Area":{"total:":{"quantity":54400,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world:":"","land:":"60 sq km; Diego Garcia 44 sq km","water:":{"quantity":54340,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"land area is about 0.3 times the size of Washington, DC","Land boundaries":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":698,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea:":{"quantity":3,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive fishing zone:":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"}},"Climate":"tropical marine; hot, humid, moderated by trade winds","Terrain":"flat and low (most areas do not exceed two meters in elevation)","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point:":"Indian Ocean 0 m","highest point:":"unnamed location on Diego Garcia 15 m"},"Natural resources":"coconuts, fish, sugarcane","Land use":{"arable land:":{"quantity":0,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops:":{"quantity":0,"unit":"%"},"other:":{"quantity":100,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"},"Natural hazards":"NA","Environment - current issues":"NA","Geography - note":"archipelago of 55 islands; Diego Garcia, largest and southernmost island, occupies strategic location in central Indian Ocean; island is site of joint US-UK military facility"},"people":{"Population":{"Population":"no indigenous inhabitants"},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":"NA","Education expenditures":"NA"},"economy":{"Economy - overview":"All economic activity is concentrated on the largest island of Diego Garcia, where a joint UK-US military facility is located.

Conservative clerical forces established a theocratic system of government with ultimate political authority vested in a learned religious scholar referred to commonly as the Supreme Leader who, according to the constitution, is accountable only to the Assembly of Experts - a popularly elected 86-member body of clerics. US-Iranian relations have been strained since a group of Iranian students seized the US Embassy in Tehran on 4 November 1979 and held it until 20 January 1981. During 1980-88, Iran fought a bloody, indecisive war with Iraq that eventually expanded into the Persian Gulf and led to clashes between US Navy and Iranian military forces between 1987 and 1988. Iran has been designated a state sponsor of terrorism for its activities in Lebanon and elsewhere in the world and remains subject to US, UN, and EU economic sanctions and export controls because of its continued involvement in terrorism and its nuclear weapons ambitions. Following the election of reformer Hojjat ol-Eslam Mohammad KHATAMI as president in 1997 and a reformist Majles (legislature) in 2000, a campaign to foster political reform in response to popular dissatisfaction was initiated. The movement floundered as conservative politicians, through the control of unelected institutions, prevented reform measures from being enacted and increased repressive measures. Starting with nationwide municipal elections in 2003 and continuing through Majles elections in 2004, conservatives reestablished control over Iran's elected government institutions, which culminated with the August 2005 inauguration of hardliner Mahmud AHMADI-NEJAD as president. His controversial reelection in June 2009 sparked nationwide protests over allegations of electoral fraud. The UN Security Council has passed a number of resolutions (1696 in July 2006, 1737 in December 2006, 1747 in March 2007, 1803 in March 2008, and 1835 in September 2008 and 1929 in June 2010) calling for Iran to suspend its uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities and comply with its IAEA obligations and responsibilities. Resolutions 1737, 1477, 1803 and 1929 subject a number of Iranian individuals and entities involved in Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs to sanctions. Additionally, several Iranian entities are subject to US sanctions under Executive Order 13382 designations for proliferation activities and EO 13224 designations for support of terrorism. In mid-February 2011, opposition activists conducted the largest antiregime rallies since December 2009, spurred by the success of uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt. Protester turnout probably was at most tens of thousands and security forces were deployed to disperse protesters. Additional protests in March 2011 failed to elicit significant participation largely because of the robust security response, although discontent still smolders.","geo":{"Location":"Middle East, bordering the Gulf of Oman, the Persian Gulf, and the Caspian Sea, between Iraq and Pakistan","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":32,"min":0},"E":{"deg":53,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total:":{"quantity":1648,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world:":"","land:":{"quantity":1531,"unit":"sq km"},"water:":{"quantity":116600,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than Alaska","Land boundaries":{"total:":{"quantity":5440,"unit":"km"},"border countries:":"Afghanistan 936 km, Armenia 35 km, Azerbaijan-proper 432 km, Azerbaijan-Naxcivan exclave 179 km, Iraq 1,458 km, Pakistan 909 km, Turkey 499 km, Turkmenistan 992 km"},"Coastline":"2,440 km;

Private sector activity is typically limited to small-scale workshops, farming, and services. Price controls, subsidies, and other rigidities weigh down the economy, undermining the potential for private-sector-led growth. Significant informal market activity flourishes. The legislature in late 2009 passed President Mahmud AHMADI-NEJAD's bill to reduce subsidies, particularly on food and energy. The bill would phase out subsidies - which benefit Iran's upper and middle classes the most - over three to five years and replace them with cash payments to Iran's lower classes. However, the start of the program was delayed repeatedly throughout 2010 over fears of public reaction to higher prices. This is the most extensive economic reform since the government implemented gasoline rationing in 2007. The recovery of world oil prices in the last year increased Iran's oil export revenue by at least $10 billion over 2009, easing some of the financial impact of the newest round of international sanctions. Although inflation has fallen substantially since the mid-2000s, Iran continues to suffer from double-digit unemployment and underemployment. Underemployment among Iran's educated youth has convinced many to seek jobs overseas, resulting in a significant \"brain drain.\"","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":818700000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":357200000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":1,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":11,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":45.9,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":43.1,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":{"Labor force":25700000,"country comparison to the world:":""},"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":25,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":31,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":45,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":14.6,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":18,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":2.6,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":29.6,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":44.5,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":27.6,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":105700000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":98830000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":16.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":11.8,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Central bank discount rate":"NA%","Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":12,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":50370000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":167400000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":132199999999.99998},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":63300000000},"Agriculture - products":"wheat, rice, other grains, sugar beets, sugar cane, fruits, nuts, cotton; dairy products, wool; caviar","Industries":"petroleum, petrochemicals, fertilizers, caustic soda, textiles, cement and other construction materials, food processing (particularly sugar refining and vegetable oil production), ferrous and non-ferrous metal fabrication, armaments","Industrial production growth rate":"4.3% excluding oil (2010 est.)","Electricity - production":{"quantity":212800000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":206700000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":6150000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":2060000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":4171999.9999999995,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":1809000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":2400000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":168000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"Oil - proved reserves":"137.6 billion bbl based on Iranian claims","country comparison to the world:":""},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":200000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":140000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":5400000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":5200000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":29610000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":9760000000},"Exports":{"usd":78690000000},"Exports - commodities":"petroleum 80%, chemical and petrochemical products, fruits and nuts, carpets","Exports - partners":"China 16.58%, Japan 11.9%, India 10.54%, South Korea 7.54%, Turkey 4.36% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":58970000000},"Imports - commodities":"industrial supplies, capital goods, foodstuffs and other consumer goods, technical services","Imports - partners":"UAE 15.14%, China 13.48%, Germany 9.66%, South Korea 7.16%, Italy 5.27%, Russia 4.81%, India 4.12% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":75060000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":12840000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":16820000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":2075000000.0000002},"Exchange rates":"Iranian rials (IRR) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"is","name":"Israel","region":"Middle East","background":"Following World War II, the British withdrew from their mandate of Palestine, and the UN partitioned the area into Arab and Jewish states, an arrangement rejected by the Arabs. Subsequently, the Israelis defeated the Arabs in a series of wars without ending the deep tensions between the two sides. The territories Israel occupied since the 1967 war are not included in the Israel country profile, unless otherwise noted. On 25 April 1982, Israel withdrew from the Sinai pursuant to the 1979 Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty. In keeping with the framework established at the Madrid Conference in October 1991, bilateral negotiations were conducted between Israel and Palestinian representatives and Syria to achieve a permanent settlement. Israel and Palestinian officials signed on 13 September 1993 a Declaration of Principles (also known as the \"Oslo Accords\") guiding an interim period of Palestinian self-rule. Outstanding territorial and other disputes with Jordan were resolved in the 26 October 1994 Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace. In addition, on 25 May 2000, Israel withdrew unilaterally from southern Lebanon, which it had occupied since 1982. In April 2003, US President BUSH, working in conjunction with the EU, UN, and Russia - the \"Quartet\" - took the lead in laying out a roadmap to a final settlement of the conflict by 2005, based on reciprocal steps by the two parties leading to two states, Israel and a democratic Palestine. However, progress toward a permanent status agreement was undermined by Israeli-Palestinian violence between September 2003 and February 2005. In the summer of 2005, Israel unilaterally disengaged from the Gaza Strip, evacuating settlers and its military while retaining control over most points of entry into the Gaza Strip. The election of HAMAS to head the Palestinian Legislative Council froze relations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA). Ehud OLMERT became prime minister in March 2006 and presided over a 34-day conflict with Hizballah in Lebanon in June-August 2006 and a 23-day conflict with HAMAS in the Gaza Strip during December 2008 and January 2009. OLMERT, who in June 2007 resumed talks with PA President Mahmoud ABBAS, resigned in September 2008. Prime Minister Binyamin NETANYAHU formed a coalition in March 2009 following a February 2009 general election. Direct talks launched in September 2010 collapsed following the expiration of Israel's 10-month partial settlement construction moratorium in the West Bank.

It depends on imports of crude oil, grains, raw materials, and military equipment. Despite limited natural resources, Israel has intensively developed its agricultural and industrial sectors over the past 20 years. Cut diamonds, high-technology equipment, and agricultural products (fruits and vegetables) are the leading exports. Israel usually posts sizable trade deficits, which are covered by large transfer payments from abroad and by foreign loans. Roughly half of the government's external debt is owed to the US, its major source of economic and military aid. Israel's GDP, after contracting slightly in 2001 and 2002 due to the Palestinian conflict and troubles in the high-technology sector, grew about 5% per year from 2004-07. The global financial crisis of 2008-09 spurred a brief recession in Israel, but the country entered the crisis with solid fundamentals - following years of prudent fiscal policy and a series of liberalizing reforms - and a resilient banking sector, and the economy has shown signs of an early recovery. Following GDP growth of 4% in 2008, Israel's GDP slipped to 0.2% in 2009, but reached 3.4% in 2010, as exports rebounded. The global economic downturn affected Israel's economy primarily through reduced demand for Israel's exports in the United States and EU, Israel's top trading partners. Exports of goods and services account for about 40% of the country's GDP. The Israeli Government responded to the recession by implementing a modest fiscal stimulus package and an aggressive expansionary monetary policy - including cutting interest rates to record lows, purchasing government bonds, and intervening in the foreign currency market. The Bank of Israel began raising interest rates in the summer of 2009 when inflation rose above the upper end of the Bank's target and the economy began to show signs of recovery.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":219400000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":213100000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":4.6,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":2.4,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":32.6,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":65,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":3080000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":2,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":16,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":82,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":6.4,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":23.6,"unit":"%"}},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":2.5,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":24.3,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":39.2,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":16.7,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":60590000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":68680000000.00001}},"Public debt":{"quantity":77.3,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":2.6,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":1,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":3.73,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":27580000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":208800000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":169900000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":182100000000},"Agriculture - products":"citrus, vegetables, cotton; beef, poultry, dairy products","Industries":"high-technology products (including aviation, communications, computer-aided design and manufactures, medical electronics, fiber optics), wood and paper products, potash and phosphates, food, beverages, and tobacco, caustic soda, cement, construction, metals products, chemical products, plastics, diamond cutting, textiles, footwear","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":5.7,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":54500000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":46380000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":2081000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":3806,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":231000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":69580,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":318900,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":1940000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":1190000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":1190000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":"NA","Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":30440000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":6269000000},"Exports":{"usd":54310000000},"Exports - commodities":"machinery and equipment, software, cut diamonds, agricultural products, chemicals, textiles and apparel","Exports - partners":"US 35.05%, Hong Kong 6.02%, Belgium 4.95% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":55600000000},"Imports - commodities":"raw materials, military equipment, investment goods, rough diamonds, fuels, grain, consumer goods","Imports - partners":"US 12.35%, China 7.43%, Germany 7.1%, Switzerland 6.94%, Belgium 5.42%, Italy 4.49%, UK 4.03%, Netherlands 3.98% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":66980000000.00001},"Debt - external":{"usd":89680000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":64819999999.99999},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":58420000000},"Exchange rates":"new Israeli shekels (ILS) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"it","name":"Italy","region":"Europe","background":"Italy became a nation-state in 1861 when the regional states of the peninsula, along with Sardinia and Sicily, were united under King Victor EMMANUEL II.

The Italian economy is driven in large part by the manufacture of high-quality consumer goods produced by small and medium-sized enterprises, many of them family owned. Italy also has a sizable underground economy, which by some estimates accounts for as much as 15% of GDP. These activities are most common within the agriculture, construction, and service sectors. Italy has moved slowly on implementing needed structural reforms, such as reducing graft, overhauling costly entitlement programs, and increasing employment opportunities for young workers, particularly women. The international financial crisis worsened conditions in Italy's labor market, with unemployment rising from 6.2% in 2007 to 8.4% in 2010, but in the longer-term Italy's low fertility rate and quota-driven immigration policies will increasingly strain its economy. A rise in exports and investment driven by the global economic recovery nevertheless helped the economy grow by about 1% in 2010 following a 5% contraction in 2009. The Italian government has struggled to limit government spending, but Italy's exceedingly high public debt remains above 115% of GDP, and its fiscal deficit - just 1.5% of GDP in 2007 - exceeded 5% in 2009 and 2010, as the costs of servicing the country's debt rose.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":1774000000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":2055000000000.0002},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":1.3,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":1.8,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":24.9,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":73.3,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":25050000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":4.2,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":30.7,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":65.1,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":8.4,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":2.3,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":26.8,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":32,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":19.1,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":940300000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":1042000000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":118.1,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1.4,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":1.75,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":10.26,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":1234000000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":1884000000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":3274000000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":317300000000},"Agriculture - products":"fruits, vegetables, grapes, potatoes, sugar beets, soybeans, grain, olives; beef, dairy products; fish","Industries":"tourism, machinery, iron and steel, chemicals, food processing, textiles, motor vehicles, clothing, footwear, ceramics","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":0.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":289700000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":315000000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":3431000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":43000000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":146500,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":1537000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":586900,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":1911000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":423700000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":8119000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":78120000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":124000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":69240000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":69830000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-61.98 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":458400000000},"Exports - commodities":"engineering products, textiles and clothing, production machinery, motor vehicles, transport equipment, chemicals; food, beverages and tobacco; minerals, and nonferrous metals","Exports - partners":"Germany 12.6%, France 11.57%, US 5.92%, Spain 5.69%, UK 5.13%, Switzerland 4.69% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":459700000000},"Imports - commodities":"engineering products, chemicals, transport equipment, energy products, minerals and nonferrous metals, textiles and clothing; food, beverages, and tobacco","Imports - partners":"Germany 16.68%, France 8.82%, China 6.53%, Netherlands 5.63%, Spain 4.3%, Russia 4.12%, Belgium 4.08% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":"$NA (31 December 2010 est.)","Debt - external":{"usd":2223000000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":405100000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":601100000000},"Exchange rates":"euros (EUR) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"iv","name":"Cote d'Ivoire","region":"Africa","background":"Close ties to France since independence in 1960, the development of cocoa production for export, and foreign investment made Cote d'Ivoire one of the most prosperous of the West African states, but did not protect it from political turmoil. In December 1999, a military coup - the first ever in Cote d'Ivoire's history - overthrew the government. Junta leader Robert GUEI blatantly rigged elections held in late 2000 and declared himself the winner. Popular protest forced him to step aside and brought Laurent GBAGBO into power. Ivorian dissidents and disaffected members of the military launched a failed coup attempt in September 2002. Rebel forces claimed the northern half of the country, and in January 2003 were granted ministerial positions in a unity government under the auspices of the Linas-Marcoussis Peace Accord. President GBAGBO and rebel forces resumed implementation of the peace accord in December 2003 after a three-month stalemate, but issues that sparked the civil war, such as land reform and grounds for citizenship, remained unresolved. In March 2007 President GBAGBO and former New Force rebel leader Guillaume SORO signed the Ouagadougou Political Agreement. As a result of the agreement, SORO joined GBAGBO's government as Prime Minister and the two agreed to reunite the country by dismantling the zone of confidence separating North from South, integrate rebel forces into the national armed forces, and hold elections. Disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration of rebel forces have been problematic as rebels seek to enter the armed forces. Citizen identification and voter registration pose election difficulties, and balloting planned for November 2009 was postponed to 2010. On 28 November 2010, Alassane Dramane OUATTARA won the presidential election, defeating then President Laurent GBAGBO. GBAGBO refused to hand over power, resulting in a 6-month stand-off. In April 2011, after widespread fighting, GBAGBO was formally forced from office by OUATTARA supporters with the support of UN and French forces. Several thousand UN troops and several hundred French remain in Cote d'Ivoire to support the transition process.","geo":{"Location":"Western Africa, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean, between Ghana and Liberia","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":8,"min":0},"W":{"deg":5,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total:":{"quantity":322463,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world:":"","land:":{"quantity":318003,"unit":"sq km"},"water:":{"quantity":4460,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly larger than New Mexico","Land boundaries":{"total:":{"quantity":3110,"unit":"km"},"border countries:":"Burkina Faso 584 km, Ghana 668 km, Guinea 610 km, Liberia 716 km, Mali 532 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":515,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea:":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone:":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf:":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"}},"Climate":"tropical along coast, semiarid in far north;

Cocoa, oil, and coffee are the country's top export revenue earners, but the country is also producing gold. Since the end of the civil war in 2003, political turmoil has continued to damage the economy, resulting in the loss of foreign investment and slow economic growth. GDP grew by more than 2% in 2008 and around 4% per year in 2009-10. Per capita income has declined by 15% since 1999, but registered a slight improvement in 2009-10. Power cuts caused by a turbine failure in early 2010 slowed economic activity. Cote d'Ivoire in 2010 signed agreements to restructure its Paris Club bilateral, other bilateral, and London Club debt.

In stages over the next dozen years, Iraq attained its independence as a kingdom in 1932. A \"republic\" was proclaimed in 1958, but in actuality a series of strongmen ruled the country until 2003. The last was SADDAM Husayn. Territorial disputes with Iran led to an inconclusive and costly eight-year war (1980-88). In August 1990, Iraq seized Kuwait but was expelled by US-led, UN coalition forces during the Gulf War of January-February 1991. Following Kuwait's liberation, the UN Security Council (UNSC) required Iraq to scrap all weapons of mass destruction and long-range missiles and to allow UN verification inspections. Continued Iraqi noncompliance with UNSC resolutions over a period of 12 years led to the US-led invasion of Iraq in March 2003 and the ouster of the SADDAM Husayn regime. US forces remained in Iraq under a UNSC mandate through 2009 and under a bilateral security agreement thereafter, helping to provide security and to train and mentor Iraqi security forces. In October 2005, Iraqis approved a constitution in a national referendum and, pursuant to this document, elected a 275-member Council of Representatives (CoR) in December 2005. The CoR approved most cabinet ministers in May 2006, marking the transition to Iraq's first constitutional government in nearly a half century. In  January 2009, Iraq held elections for provincial councils in all provinces except for the three provinces comprising the Kurdistan Regional Government and Kirkuk province.

Broader economic improvement, long-term fiscal health, and sustained increases in the standard of living still depend on the government passing major policy reforms and on continued development of Iraq's massive oil reserves. Although foreign investors viewed Iraq with increasing interest in 2010, most are still hampered by difficulties in acquiring land for projects and by other regulatory impediments. Iraq's economy is dominated by the oil sector, which provides over 90% of government revenue and 80% of foreign exchange earnings. Since mid-2009, oil export earnings have returned to levels seen before Operation Iraqi Freedom and government revenues have rebounded, along with global oil prices. In 2011 Baghdad probably will increase oil exports above the current level of 1.9 million barrels per day (bbl/day) as a result of new contracts with international oil companies, but is likely to fall short of the 2.4 million bbl/day it is forecasting in its budget. Iraq is making modest progress in building the institutions needed to implement economic policy. In 2010, Bagdad signed a new agreement with both the IMF and World Bank for conditional aid programs that will help strengthen Iraq's economic institutions. Some reform-minded leaders within the Iraqi government are seeking to pass laws to strengthen the economy. This legislation includes a package of laws to establish a modern legal framework for the oil sector and a mechanism to equitably divide oil revenues within the nation, although these and other important reforms are still under contentious and sporadic negotiation. Iraq's recent contracts with major oil companies have the potential to greatly expand oil revenues, but Iraq will need to upgrade its oil processing, pipeline, and export infrastructure to enable these deals to reach their potential. The Government of Iraq is pursuing a strategy to gain additional foreign investment in Iraq's economy. This includes an amendment to the National Investment Law, multiple international trade and investment events, as well as potential participation in joint ventures with state-owned enterprises. Provincial Councils also are using their own budgets to promote and facilitate investment at the local level. However, widespread corruption, inadequate infrastructure, insufficient essential services, and antiquated commercial laws and regulations stifle investment and continue to constrain the growth of private, non-energy sectors. The Central Bank has successfully held the exchange rate at approximately 1,170 Iraqi dinar/US dollar since January 2009. Inflation has decreased consistently since 2006 as the security situation has improved. However, Iraqi leaders remain hard pressed to translate macroeconomic gains into improved lives for ordinary Iraqis. Unemployment remains a problem throughout the country. Reducing corruption and implementing reforms - such as bank restructuring and developing the private sector - would be important steps in this direction.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":113400000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":82150000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":0.8,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":9.7,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":63,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":27.3,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":8500000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":21.6,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":18.7,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":59.8,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":15.3,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":25,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":"NA%","highest 10%:":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":52800000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":72400000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":4.2,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":8.83,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":15.64,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":35690000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":46010000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":21940000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":2600000000},"Agriculture - products":"wheat, barley, rice, vegetables, dates, cotton; cattle, sheep, poultry","Industries":"petroleum, chemicals, textiles, leather, construction materials, food processing, fertilizer, metal fabrication/processing","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":4.8,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":46390000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":52000000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":5600000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":2399000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":687000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":1910000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":116900,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":115000000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":1880000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":9454000000,"unit":"cu m"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":3170000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":2715000000},"Exports":{"usd":49100000000},"Exports - commodities":"crude oil 84%, crude materials excluding fuels, food and live animals","Exports - partners":"US 27.62%, India 14.45%, Italy 10.14%, South Korea 8.62%, Taiwan 5.61%, China 4.23%, Netherlands 4.13%, Japan 3.99% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":42560000000},"Imports - commodities":"food, medicine, manufactures","Imports - partners":"Turkey 24.99%, Syria 17.36%, US 8.66%, China 6.79%, Jordan 4.17%, Italy 3.98%, Germany 3.97% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":45680000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":52580000000},"Exchange rates":"Iraqi dinars (IQD) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"ja","name":"Japan","region":"East & Southeast Asia","background":"In 1603, after decades of civil warfare, the Tokugawa shogunate (a military-led, dynastic government) ushered in a long period of relative political stability and isolation from foreign influence. For more than two centuries this policy enabled Japan to enjoy a flowering of its indigenous culture. Japan opened its ports after signing the Treaty of Kanagawa with the US in 1854 and began to intensively modernize and industrialize. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Japan became a regional power that was able to defeat the forces of both China and Russia. It occupied Korea, Formosa (Taiwan), and southern Sakhalin Island. In 1931-32 Japan occupied Manchuria, and in 1937 it launched a full-scale invasion of China. Japan attacked US forces in 1941 - triggering America's entry into World War II - and soon occupied much of East and Southeast Asia. After its defeat in World War II, Japan recovered to become an economic power and an ally of the US. While the emperor retains his throne as a symbol of national unity, elected politicians hold actual decision-making power. Following three decades of unprecedented growth, Japan's economy experienced a major slowdown starting in the 1990s, but the country remains a major economic power. In March 2011, Japan's strongest-ever earthquake, and an accompanying tsunami, devastated the northeast part of Honshu island, killing thousands and damaging several nuclear power plants. The catastrophe hobbled the country's economy and its energy infrastructure, and severely strained its capacity to deal with the humanitarian disaster.","geo":{"Location":"Eastern Asia, island chain between the North Pacific Ocean and the Sea of Japan, east of the Korean Peninsula","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":36,"min":0},"E":{"deg":138,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total:":{"quantity":377915,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world:":"","land:":{"quantity":364485,"unit":"sq km"},"water:":{"quantity":13430,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than California","Land boundaries":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":29751,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea:":"12 nm;

Two notable characteristics of the post-war economy were the close interlocking structures of manufacturers, suppliers, and distributors, known as keiretsu, and the guarantee of lifetime employment for a substantial portion of the urban labor force. Both features are now eroding under the dual pressures of global competition and domestic demographic change. Japan's industrial sector is heavily dependent on imported raw materials and fuels. A tiny agricultural sector is highly subsidized and protected, with crop yields among the highest in the world. Usually self sufficient in rice, Japan imports about 60% of its food on a caloric basis. Japan maintains one of the world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the global catch. For three decades, overall real economic growth had been spectacular - a 10% average in the 1960s, a 5% average in the 1970s, and a 4% average in the 1980s. Growth slowed markedly in the 1990s, averaging just 1.7%, largely because of the after effects of inefficient investment and an asset price bubble in the late 1980s that required a protracted period of time for firms to reduce excess debt, capital, and labor. Measured on a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis that adjusts for price differences, Japan in 2010 stood as the third-largest economy in the world after China, which surpassed Japan in 2001. The Japanese financial sector was not heavily exposed to sub-prime mortgages or their derivative instruments and weathered the initial effect of the recent global credit crunch, but a sharp downturn in business investment and global demand for Japan's exports in late 2008 pushed Japan further into recession. Government stimulus spending helped the economy recover in late 2009 and 2010. Prime Minister KAN's government has proposed opening the agricultural and services sectors to greater foreign competition and boosting exports through free-trade agreements, but debate continues on restructuring the economy and funding new stimulus programs in the face of a tight fiscal situation. Japan's huge government debt, which exceeds 200% of GDP, persistent deflation, reliance on exports to drive growth, and an aging and shrinking population are major long-term challenges for the economy. A 9.0-magnitude earthquake and an ensuing tsunami devastated the northeast coast of Honshu Island on 11 March 2011, washing away buildings and infrastructure as much as 6 miles inland, killing thousands, severely damaging several nuclear power plants, displacing and leaving homeless more than 320,000 people, and leaving a million households without running water. Radiation leaks at the Fukushima Daiichai nuclear power plant prompted mass evacuations and the declaration of a no-fly zone - initially for people and planes within 12.5 miles of the plant but later expanded to 19 miles. Radioactive iodine-131 has been found as far as 100 miles from the plant in samples of water, milk, fish, beef, and certain vegetables, at levels that make these foods unfit for consumption and create uncertainty regarding possible long-term contamination of the area. Energy-cutting efforts by electric companies and train lines slowed the pace of business throughout Honshu Island, and the stock market gyrated, dropping as much as 10% in a single day. In order to stabilize financial markets and retard appreciation of the yen, the Bank of Japan injected more than $325 billion in yen into the economy. Estimates of the direct costs of the damage - rebuilding homes and factories - range from $235 billion to $310 billion. Some economic forecasters, who previously had anticipated slower growth for Japan in 2011, now believe GDP may decline as much as 1% for the year.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":4309999999999.9995},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":5459000000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":3.9,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":1.1,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":23,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":75.9,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":65700000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":3.9,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":26.2,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":69.8,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":5.1,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":15.7,"unit":"%"}},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":1.9,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":27.5,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":37.6,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":20.3,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":1638000000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":2160000000000.0002}},"Public debt":{"quantity":225.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":"-0.7% (2010 est.)","Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":0.3,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":1.6,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":5712000000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":16460000000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":16390000000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":3537000000000},"Agriculture - products":"rice, sugar beets, vegetables, fruit; pork, poultry, dairy products, eggs; fish","Industries":"among world's largest and technologically advanced producers of motor vehicles, electronic equipment, machine tools, steel and nonferrous metals, ships, chemicals, textiles, processed foods","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":15.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":956500000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":858500000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":132700,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":4363000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":380900,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":5033000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":44120000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":3539000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":94670000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":90290000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":20900000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":166500000000},"Exports":{"usd":765200000000},"Exports - commodities":"transport equipment, motor vehicles, semiconductors, electrical machinery, chemicals","Exports - partners":"China 18.88%, US 16.42%, South Korea 8.13%, Taiwan 6.27%, Hong Kong 5.49% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":636800000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery and equipment, fuels, foodstuffs, chemicals, textiles, raw materials","Imports - partners":"China 22.2%, US 10.96%, Australia 6.29%, Saudi Arabia 5.29%, UAE 4.12%, South Korea 3.98%, Indonesia 3.95% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":1096000000000.0001},"Debt - external":{"usd":2441000000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":199400000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":719900000000},"Exchange rates":"yen (JPY) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"je","name":"Jersey","region":"Europe","background":"Jersey and the other Channel Islands represent the last remnants of the medieval Dukedom of Normandy that held sway in both France and England.

The abolition of slavery in 1834 freed a quarter million slaves, many of whom became small farmers. Jamaica gradually obtained increasing independence from Britain. In 1958 it joined other British Caribbean colonies in forming the Federation of the West Indies. Jamaica gained full independence when it withdrew from the Federation in 1962. Deteriorating economic conditions during the 1970s led to recurrent violence as rival gangs affiliated with the major political parties evolved into powerful organized crime networks involved in international drug smuggling and money laundering.

The country continues to derive most of its foreign exchange from tourism, remittances, and bauxite/alumina. Remittances account for nearly 15% of GDP and exports of bauxite and alumina make up about 10%. The bauxite/alumina sector was most affected by the global downturn while the tourism industry was resilient, experiencing an increase of 4% in tourist arrivals. Tourism revenues account for roughly 10% of GDP, and both arrivals and revenues grew in 2010, up 4% and 6% respectively. The Economic growth faces many challenges: high crime and corruption, large-scale unemployment and underemployment, and a debt-to-GDP ratio of more than 120%. Jamaica's onerous public debt burden - the fourth highest in the world on a per capita basis - is the result of government bailouts to ailing sectors of the economy, most notably to the financial sector in the mid-to-late 1990s. In early 2010, the Jamaican government created the Jamaica Debt Exchange (JDX) in order to retire high-priced domestic bonds and significantly reduce annual debt servicing. The Government of Jamaica signed a $1.27 billion, 27-month Standby Agreement with the International Monetary Fund for balance of payment support in February 2010. Other multilaterals have also provided millions of dollars in loans and grants. Despite the improvement, debt servicing costs still hinder the government's ability to spend on infrastructure and social programs, particularly as job losses rise in a shrinking economy. The GOLDING administration faces the difficult prospect of having to achieve fiscal discipline in order to maintain debt payments, while simultaneously attacking a serious crime problem that is hampering economic growth. High unemployment exacerbates the crime problem, including gang violence that is fueled by the drug trade.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":23720000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":13690000000},"GDP - real growth rate":"-1.1% (2010 est.)","GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":5.7,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":29.7,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":64.6,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":1317000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":17,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":19,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":64,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":12.9,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":16.5,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":2.1,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":35.8,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":45.5,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":25.1,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":3611000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":4644000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":123.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":13,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":"NA%","Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":16.43,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":1432000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":5782000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":7922000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":6201000000},"Agriculture - products":"sugarcane, bananas, coffee, citrus, yams, ackees, vegetables; poultry, goats, milk; crustaceans, mollusks","Industries":"tourism, bauxite/alumina, agro processing, light manufactures, rum, cement, metal, paper, chemical products, telecommunications","Industrial production growth rate":"-2% (2010 est.)","Electricity - production":{"quantity":7324000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":6345000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":77000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":77720,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-1.382 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":1487000000},"Exports - commodities":"alumina, bauxite, sugar, rum, coffee, yams, beverages, chemicals, wearing apparel, mineral fuels","Exports - partners":"US 38.19%, Canada 12.2%, UK 10.79%, Norway 4.89%, Netherlands 4.69% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":5378000000},"Imports - commodities":"food and other consumer goods, industrial supplies, fuel, parts and accessories of capital goods, machinery and transport equipment, construction materials","Imports - partners":"US 28.32%, Trinidad and Tobago 22.98%, Venezuela 12.14%, China 4.61%, Brazil 4.18% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":1850000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":12660000000},"Exchange rates":"Jamaican dollars (JMD) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"jn","name":"Jan Mayen","region":"Europe","background":"This desolate, arctic, mountainous island was named after a Dutch whaling captain who indisputably discovered it in 1614 (earlier claims are inconclusive).

Britain separated out a semi-autonomous region of Transjordan from Palestine in the early 1920s, and the area gained its independence in 1946; it adopted the name of Jordan in 1950. The country's long-time ruler was King HUSSEIN (1953-99). A pragmatic leader, he successfully navigated competing pressures from the major powers (US, USSR, and UK), various Arab states, Israel, and a large internal Palestinian population. Jordan lost the West Bank to Israel in the 1967 war and barely managed to defeat Palestinian rebels who attempted to overthrow the monarchy in 1970. King HUSSEIN in 1988 permanently relinquished Jordanian claims to the West Bank. In 1989, he reinstituted parliamentary elections and initiated a gradual political liberalization; political parties were legalized in 1992. In 1994, he signed a peace treaty with Israel. King ABDALLAH II, the son of King HUSSEIN, assumed the throne following his father's death in February 1999. Since then, he has consolidated his power and undertaken an aggressive economic reform program. Jordan acceded to the World Trade Organization in 2000, and began to participate in the European Free Trade Association in 2001. In 2003, Jordan staunchly supported the Coalition ouster of SADDAM in Iraq and, following the outbreak of insurgent violence in Iraq, absorbed thousands of displaced Iraqis. Municipal elections were held in July 2007 under a system in which 20% of seats in all municipal councils were reserved by quota for women. Parliamentary elections were held in November 2010 and saw independent pro-government candidates win the vast majority of seats. Beginning in January 2011 in the wake of unrest in Tunisia and Egypt, several thousand Jordanians staged weekly demonstrations and marches in Amman and other cities throughout Jordan to protest government corruption, rising prices, rampant poverty, and high unemployment. In response, King Abdallah replaced his prime minister and formed a National Dialogue Commission with a reform mandate. Some opposition groups also called for sweeping political and constitutional reforms, particularly on a controversial election law.","geo":{"Location":"Middle East, northwest of Saudi Arabia, between Israel (to the west) and Iraq","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":31,"min":0},"E":{"deg":36,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total:":{"quantity":89342,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world:":"","land:":{"quantity":88802,"unit":"sq km"},"water:":{"quantity":540,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than Indiana","Land boundaries":{"total:":{"quantity":1635,"unit":"km"},"border countries:":"Iraq 181 km, Israel 238 km, Saudi Arabia 744 km, Syria 375 km, West Bank 97 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":26,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea:":{"quantity":3,"unit":"nm"}},"Climate":"mostly arid desert;

Since assuming the throne in 1999, King ABDALLAH has implemented significant economic reforms, such as opening the trade regime, privatizing state-owned companies, and eliminating most fuel subsidies, which in the past few years have spurred economic growth by attracting foreign investment and creating some jobs. The global economic slowdown, however, has depressed Jordan's GDP growth. Export-oriented sectors such as manufacturing, mining, and the transport of re-exports have been hit the hardest. The Government approved two supplementary budgets in 2010, but sweeping tax cuts planned for 2010 did not materialize because of Amman's need for additional revenue to cover excess spending. The budget deficit is likely to remain high, at 5-6% of GDP, and Amman likely will continue to depend heavily on foreign assistance to finance the deficit in 2011. Jordan's financial sector has been relatively isolated from the international financial crisis because of its limited exposure to overseas capital markets.

MOI acceded to internal and external pressure for political liberalization in late 1991. The ethnically fractured opposition failed to dislodge KANU from power in elections in 1992 and 1997, which were marred by violence and fraud, but were viewed as having generally reflected the will of the Kenyan people. President MOI stepped down in December 2002 following fair and peaceful elections. Mwai KIBAKI, running as the candidate of the multiethnic, united opposition group, the National Rainbow Coalition (NARC), defeated KANU candidate Uhuru KENYATTA and assumed the presidency following a campaign centered on an anticorruption platform. KIBAKI's NARC coalition splintered in 2005 over a constitutional review process. Government defectors joined with KANU to form a new opposition coalition, the Orange Democratic Movement, which defeated the government's draft constitution in a popular referendum in November 2005. KIBAKI's reelection in December 2007 brought charges of vote rigging from ODM candidate Raila ODINGA and unleashed two months of violence in which as many as 1,500 people died. UN-sponsored talks in late February produced a powersharing accord bringing ODINGA into the government in the restored position of prime minister.

In 1997, the IMF suspended Kenya's Enhanced Structural Adjustment Program due to the government's failure to maintain reforms and curb corruption. The IMF, which had resumed loans in 2000 to help Kenya through a drought, again halted lending in 2001 when the government failed to institute several anticorruption measures. In the key December 2002 elections, Daniel Arap MOI's 24-year-old reign ended, and a new opposition government took on the formidable economic problems facing the nation. After some early progress in rooting out corruption and encouraging donor support, the KIBAKI government was rocked by high-level graft scandals in 2005 and 2006. In 2006, the World Bank and IMF delayed loans pending action by the government on corruption. The international financial institutions and donors have since resumed lending, despite little action on the government's part to deal with corruption. Post-election violence in early 2008, coupled with the effects of the global financial crisis on remittance and exports, reduced GDP growth to 1.7 in 2008, but the economy rebounded in 2009-10.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":66030000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":32159999999.999996},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":5,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":22,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":16,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":62,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":17940000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":75,"unit":"%"},"industry and services:":{"quantity":25,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":40,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":50,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":1.8,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":37.8,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":42.5,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":21.3,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":7017000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":9045000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":50.9,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":4.2,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":"NA%","Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":14.8,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":6333000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":15380000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":14110000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":10760000000},"Agriculture - products":"tea, coffee, corn, wheat, sugarcane, fruit, vegetables; dairy products, beef, pork, poultry, eggs","Industries":"small-scale consumer goods (plastic, furniture, batteries, textiles, clothing, soap, cigarettes, flour), agricultural products, horticulture, oil refining; aluminum, steel, lead; cement, commercial ship repair, tourism","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":4,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":5223000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":4863000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":58300000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":22500000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":76000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":7270,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":80530,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-1.414 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":5141000000},"Exports - commodities":"tea, horticultural products, coffee, petroleum products, fish, cement","Exports - partners":"UK 11.31%, Netherlands 9.81%, Uganda 9.07%, Tanzania 8.83%, US 5.93%, Pakistan 5.63% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":10400000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery and transportation equipment, petroleum products, motor vehicles, iron and steel, resins and plastics","Imports - partners":"India 11.67%, China 10.58%, UAE 9.32%, South Africa 8.36%, Saudi Arabia 6.53%, US 6.25%, Japan 5.1% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":4585000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":7935000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":2337000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":338000000},"Exchange rates":"Kenyan shillings (KES) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"kg","name":"Kyrgyzstan","region":"Central Asia","background":"A Central Asian country of incredible natural beauty and proud nomadic traditions, most of Kyrgyzstan was formally annexed to Russia in 1876.

Cotton, tobacco, wool, and meat are the main agricultural products, although only tobacco and cotton are exported in any quantity. Industrial exports include gold, mercury, uranium, natural gas, and electricity. The economy depends heavily on gold exports - mainly from output at the Kumtor gold mine. Following independence, Kyrgyzstan was progressive in carrying out market reforms, such as an improved regulatory system and land reform. Kyrgyzstan was the first Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) country to be accepted into the World Trade Organization. Much of the government's stock in enterprises has been sold. Drops in production had been severe after the breakup of the Soviet Union in December 1991, but by mid-1995, production began to recover and exports began to increase. In 2005, the BAKIEV government and international financial institutions initiated a comprehensive medium-term poverty reduction and economic growth strategy. Bishkek agreed to pursue much needed tax reform and, in 2006, became eligible for the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative. The government made steady strides in controlling its substantial fiscal deficit, nearly closing the gap between revenues and expenditures in 2006, before boosting expenditures more than 20% in 2007-08. GDP grew about 8% annually in 2007-08, partly due to higher gold prices internationally, but slowed to 2.3% in 2009. The overthrow of President BAKIEV in April, 2010 and subsequent ethnic clashes left hundreds dead and damaged infrastructure. Shrinking trade and agricultural production, as well as political instability, caused GDP to contract about 3.5% in 2010. The fiscal deficit widened to 11% of GDP, reflecting significant increases in crisis-related spending, including both rehabilitation of damaged infrastructure and bank recapitalization. Progress in reconstruction, fighting corruption, restructuring domestic industry, and attracting foreign aid and investment are key to future growth.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":12020000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":4615000000},"GDP - real growth rate":"-1.4% (2010 est.)","GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":24.6,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":25,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":50.4,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":2344000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":48,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":12.5,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":39.5,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":18,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":40,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":3.6,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":25.9,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":30.3,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":26.4,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":980000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":1460000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":4.8,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":9.07,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":23.03,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":714900000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":1100000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":505400000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":71840000},"Agriculture - products":"tobacco, cotton, potatoes, vegetables, grapes, fruits and berries; sheep, goats, cattle, wool","Industries":"small machinery, textiles, food processing, cement, shoes, sawn logs, refrigerators, furniture, electric motors, gold, rare earth metals","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":6,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":15960000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":9000000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":2379000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":979.1,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":15000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":1890,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":12850,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":40000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":30000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":750000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":720000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":5663000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-210 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":1682000000},"Exports - commodities":"cotton, wool, meat, tobacco; gold, mercury, uranium, natural gas, hydropower; machinery; shoes","Exports - partners":"Switzerland 25.96%, Russia 25.88%, Uzbekistan 15.72%, Kazakhstan 12.47% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":3075000000},"Imports - commodities":"oil and gas, machinery and equipment, chemicals, foodstuffs","Imports - partners":"China 57.03%, Russia 19.34%, Kazakhstan 5.9% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":1615000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":3738000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":"$NA (31 December 2009 est.)","Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA","Exchange rates":"soms (KGS) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"kn","name":"Korea, North","region":"East & Southeast Asia","background":"An independent kingdom for much of its long history, Korea was occupied by Japan beginning in 1905 following the Russo-Japanese War.

After failing in the Korean War (1950-53) to conquer the US-backed Republic of Korea (ROK) in the southern portion by force, North Korea (DPRK), under its founder President KIM Il Sung, adopted a policy of ostensible diplomatic and economic \"self-reliance\" as a check against outside influence. The DPRK demonized the US as the ultimate threat to its social system through state-funded propaganda, and molded political, economic, and military policies around the core ideological objective of eventual unification of Korea under Pyongyang's control. KIM Il Sung's son, the current ruler KIM Jong Il, was officially designated as his father's successor in 1980, assuming a growing political and managerial role until the elder KIM's death in 1994.

Industrial capital stock is nearly beyond repair as a result of years of underinvestment, shortages of spare parts, and poor maintenance. Large-scale military spending draws off resources needed for investment and civilian consumption. Industrial and power output have stagnated for years at a fraction of pre-1990 levels. Frequent weather-related crop failures aggravated chronic food shortages caused by on-going systemic problems, including a lack of arable land, collective farming practices, poor soil quality, insufficient fertilization, and persistent shortages of tractors and fuel. Large-scale international food aid deliveries have allowed the people of North Korea to escape widespread starvation since famine threatened in 1995, but the population continues to suffer from prolonged malnutrition and poor living conditions. Since 2002, the government has allowed private \"farmers' markets\" to begin selling a wider range of goods. It also permitted some private farming - on an experimental basis - in an effort to boost agricultural output. In October 2005, the government tried to reverse some of these policies by forbidding private sales of grains and reinstituting a centralized food rationing system. By December 2005, the government terminated most international humanitarian assistance operations in North Korea (calling instead for developmental assistance only) and restricted the activities of remaining international and non-governmental aid organizations. In mid-2008, North Korea began receiving food aid under a US program to deliver 500,000 metric tons of food via the World Food Program and US nongovernmental organizations; but Pyongyang stopped accepting the aid in March 2009. In December 2009, North Korea carried out a redenomination of its currency, capping the amount of North Korean won that could be exchanged for the new notes, and limiting the exchange to a one-week window. A concurrent crackdown on markets and foreign currency use yielded severe shortages and inflation, forcing Pyongyang to ease the restrictions by February 2010. In response to the sinking of the South Korean destroyer Cheonan and the shelling of Yeonpyong Island, South Korea's government cut off most aid, trade, and bilateral cooperation activities, with the exception of operations at the Kaesong Industrial Complex. The year 2012 will be the 100th anniversary of Kim Il-sung's birthday. The North Korean government often highlights its 2012 goal of becoming a \"strong and prosperous\" nation. Attracting foreign investment, especially from neighboring China, will be a key factor for improving the overall standard of living. Nevertheless, firm political control remains the government's overriding concern, which likely will inhibit changes to North Korea's current economic system.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":40000000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":28000000000},"GDP - real growth rate":"-0.9% (2009 est.)","GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":20.9,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":46.9,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":32.1,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":{"Labor force":12200000,"country comparison to the world:":""},"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":35,"unit":"%"},"industry and services:":{"quantity":65,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":"NA%","Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":"NA%","highest 10%:":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":3200000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":3300000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":"NA%","Agriculture - products":"rice, corn, potatoes, soybeans, pulses; cattle, pigs, pork, eggs","Industries":"military products; machine building, electric power, chemicals; mining (coal, iron ore, limestone, magnesite, graphite, copper, zinc, lead, and precious metals), metallurgy; textiles, food processing; tourism","Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Electricity - production":{"quantity":22500000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":18800000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":118,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":16000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":13890,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Exports":{"usd":1997000000},"Exports - commodities":"minerals, metallurgical products, manufactures (including armaments), textiles, agricultural and fishery products","Exports - partners":"South Korea 47%, China 40%, Hong Kong 2% (2009 est.)","Imports":{"usd":3096000000},"Imports - commodities":"petroleum, coking coal, machinery and equipment, textiles, grain","Imports - partners":"China 61%, South Korea 24%, Singapore 2%, India 2% (2009 est.)","Debt - external":{"usd":12500000000},"Exchange rates":"North Korean won (KPW) per US dollar (market rate)"}},{"id":"kr","name":"Kiribati","region":"Australia-Oceania","background":"The Gilbert Islands became a British protectorate in 1892 and a colony in 1915; they were captured by the Japanese in the Pacific War in 1941.

Between its initial unification in the 7th century - from three predecessor Korean states - until the 20th century, Korea existed as a single independent country. In 1905, following the Russo-Japanese War, Korea became a protectorate of imperial Japan, and in 1910 it was annexed as a colony. Korea regained its independence following Japan's surrender to the United States in 1945. After World War II, a Republic of Korea (ROK) was set up in the southern half of the Korean Peninsula while a Communist-style government was installed in the north (the DPRK). During the Korean War (1950-53), US troops and UN forces fought alongside soldiers from the ROK to defend South Korea from DPRK attacks supported by China and the Soviet Union. An armistice was signed in 1953, splitting the peninsula along a demilitarized zone at about the 38th parallel. Thereafter, South Korea achieved rapid economic growth with per capita income rising to roughly 17 times the level of North Korea. In 1993, KIM Young-sam became South Korea's first civilian president following 32 years of military rule. South Korea today is a fully functioning modern democracy. President LEE Myung-bak has pursued a policy of global engagement since taking office in February 2008, highlighted by Seoul's hosting of the G-20 summit in November 2010. Serious tensions with North Korea have punctuated inter-Korean relations in recent years, including the North's sinking of the South Korean warship Cheonan in March 2010 and its artillery attack on South Korean soldiers and citizens in November 2010.","geo":{"Location":"Eastern Asia, southern half of the Korean Peninsula bordering the Sea of Japan and the Yellow Sea","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":37,"min":0},"E":{"deg":127,"min":30}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total:":{"quantity":99720,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world:":"","land:":{"quantity":96920,"unit":"sq km"},"water:":{"quantity":2800,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly larger than Indiana","Land boundaries":{"total:":{"quantity":238,"unit":"km"},"border countries:":"North Korea 238 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":2413,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea:":"12 nm;

Four decades ago, GDP per capita was comparable with levels in the poorer countries of Africa and Asia. In 2004, South Korea joined the trillion dollar club of world economies, and currently is among the world's 20 largest economies. Initially, a system of close government and business ties, including directed credit and import restrictions, made this success possible. The government promoted the import of raw materials and technology at the expense of consumer goods, and encouraged savings and investment over consumption. The Asian financial crisis of 1997-98 exposed longstanding weaknesses in South Korea's development model including high debt/equity ratios and massive short-term foreign borrowing. GDP plunged by 6.9% in 1998, and then recovered by 9% in 1999-2000. Korea adopted numerous economic reforms following the crisis, including greater openness to foreign investment and imports. Growth moderated to about 4-5% annually between 2003 and 2007. With the global economic downturn in late 2008, South Korean GDP growth slowed to 0.2% in 2009. In the third quarter of 2009, the economy began to recover, in large part due to export growth, low interest rates, and an expansionary fiscal policy, and growth exceeded 6% in 2010. The South Korean economy's long term challenges include a rapidly aging population, inflexible labor market, and overdependence on manufacturing exports to drive economic growth.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":1459000000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":1006999999999.9999},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":6.1,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":39.4,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":57.6,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":24620000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":7.3,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":24.3,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":68.4,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":3.3,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":15,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":2.7,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":24.2,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":31.4,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":28.7,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":248300000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":267300000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":23.7,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":1.25,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":5.65,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":101900000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":1346000000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":1057000000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":836500000000},"Agriculture - products":"rice, root crops, barley, vegetables, fruit; cattle, pigs, chickens, milk, eggs; fish","Industries":"electronics, telecommunications, automobile production, chemicals, shipbuilding, steel","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":12.1,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":417000000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":402000000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":48180,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":2185000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"Oil - exports":{"quantity":907100,"unit":"bbl/day"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":3074000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":651000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":34090000000.000004,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":32689999999.999996,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":50000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":36350000000},"Exports":{"usd":466300000000},"Exports - commodities":"semiconductors, wireless telecommunications equipment, motor vehicles, computers, steel, ships, petrochemicals","Exports - partners":"China 23.2%, US 10.1%, Japan 5.8%, Hong Kong 5.3% (2009 est.)","Imports":{"usd":417900000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery, electronics and electronic equipment, oil, steel, transport equipment, organic chemicals, plastics","Imports - partners":"China 16.8%, Japan 15.3%, US 9%, Saudi Arabia 6.1%, Australia 4.6% (2009 est.)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":274600000000.00003},"Debt - external":{"usd":370100000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":112100000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":115600000000},"Exchange rates":"South Korean won (KRW) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"kt","name":"Christmas Island","region":"Australia-Oceania","background":"Named in 1643 for the day of its discovery, the island was annexed and settlement began by the UK in 1888.

Amid the 2010-11 uprisings and protests across the Arab world, stateless Arabs, known as bidoon, staged small protests in February and March 2011 demanding citizenship, jobs, and other benefits available to Kuwaiti nationals. Youth activist groups - supported by opposition legislators and the prime minister's rivals within the ruling family - in March of 2011 rallied for an end to corruption and the prime minister's ouster.","geo":{"Location":"Middle East, bordering the Persian Gulf, between Iraq and Saudi Arabia","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":29,"min":30},"E":{"deg":45,"min":45}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total:":{"quantity":17818,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world:":"","land:":{"quantity":17818,"unit":"sq km"},"water:":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than New Jersey","Land boundaries":{"total:":{"quantity":462,"unit":"km"},"border countries:":"Iraq 240 km, Saudi Arabia 222 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":499,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea:":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"}},"Climate":"dry desert;

The rise in global oil prices throughout 2010 is reviving government consumption and economic growth as Kuwait experiences a 20% increase in government budget revenue. Kuwait has done little to diversify its economy, in part, because of this positive fiscal situation, and, in part, due to the poor business climate and the acrimonious relationship between the National Assembly and the executive branch, which has stymied most movement on economic reforms. Nonetheless, the government in May 2010 passed a privatization bill that allows the government to sell assets to private investors, and in January passed an economic development plan that pledges to spend up to $130 billion in five years to diversify the economy away from oil, attract more investment, and boost private sector participation in the economy.

During the medieval period, Kosovo became the center of a Serbian Empire and saw the construction of many important Serb religious sites, including many architecturally significant Serbian Orthodox monasteries. The defeat of Serbian forces at the Battle of Kosovo in 1389 led to five centuries of Ottoman rule during which large numbers of Turks and Albanians moved to Kosovo. By the end of the 19th century, Albanians replaced the Serbs as the dominant ethnic group in Kosovo. Serbia reacquired control over Kosovo from the Ottoman Empire during the First Balkan War of 1912. After World War II, Kosovo became an autonomous province of Serbia in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (S.F.R.Y.) with status almost equivalent to that of a republic under the 1974 S.F.R.Y. constitution. Despite legislative concessions, Albanian nationalism increased in the 1980s, which led to riots and calls for Kosovo's independence. At the same time, Serb nationalist leaders, such as Slobodan MILOSEVIC, exploited Kosovo Serb claims of maltreatment to secure votes from supporters, many of whom viewed Kosovo as their cultural heartland. Under MILOSEVIC's leadership, Serbia instituted a new constitution in 1989 that revoked Kosovo's status as an autonomous province of Serbia. Kosovo Albanian leaders responded in 1991 by organizing a referendum that declared Kosovo independent. Under MILOSEVIC, Serbia carried out repressive measures against the Albanians in the early 1990s as the unofficial Kosovo government, led by Ibrahim RUGOVA, used passive resistance in an attempt to try to gain international assistance and recognition of an independent Kosovo. Albanians dissatisfied with RUGOVA's passive strategy in the 1990s created the Kosovo Liberation Army and launched an insurgency. Starting in 1998, Serbian military, police, and paramilitary forces under MILOSEVIC conducted a brutal counterinsurgency campaign that resulted in massacres and massive expulsions of ethnic Albanians. Approximately 800,000 Albanians were forced from their homes in Kosovo during this time. International attempts to mediate the conflict failed, and MILOSEVIC's rejection of a proposed settlement led to a three-month NATO military operation against Serbia beginning in March 1999 that forced Serbia to agree to withdraw its military and police forces from Kosovo. UN Security Council Resolution 1244 (1999) placed Kosovo under a transitional administration, the UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), pending a determination of Kosovo's future status. A UN-led process began in late 2005 to determine Kosovo's final status. The negotiations ran in stages between 2006 and 2007, but ended without agreement between Belgrade and Pristina. On 17 February 2008, the Kosovo Assembly declared Kosovo independent. Since then, over 70 countries have recognized Kosovo, and it has joined the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. Serbia continues to reject Kosovo's independence and in October 2008, it sought an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on the legality under international law of Kosovo's declaration of independence. The ICJ released the advisory opinion in July 2010 affirming that Kosovo's declaration of independence did not violate general principles of international law, UN Security Council Resolution 1244, or the Constitutive Framework. The opinion was closely tailored to Kosovo's unique history and circumstances.","geo":{"Location":"Southeast Europe, between Serbia and Macedonia","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":42,"min":35},"E":{"deg":21,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total:":{"quantity":10887,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world:":"","land:":{"quantity":10887,"unit":"sq km"},"water:":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly larger than Delaware","Land boundaries":{"total:":{"quantity":702,"unit":"km"},"border countries:":"Albania 112 km, Macedonia 159 km, Montenegro 79 km, Serbia 352 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":"none (landlocked)","Climate":"influenced by continental air masses resulting in relatively cold winters with heavy snowfall and hot, dry summers and autumns; Mediterranean and alpine influences create regional variation; maximum rainfall between October and December","Terrain":"flat fluvial basin with an elevation of 400-700 m above sea level surrounded by several high mountain ranges with elevations of 2,000 to 2,500 m","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point:":"Drini i Bardhe/Beli Drim 297 m (located on the border with Albania)","highest point:":"Gjeravica/Deravica 2,656 m"},"Natural resources":"nickel, lead, zinc, magnesium, lignite, kaolin, chrome, bauxite"},"people":{"Population":1825,"Age structure":{"0-14 years:":{"quantity":27.2,"unit":"%"},"15-64 years:":{"quantity":66.1,"unit":"%"},"65 years and over:":"6.7% (male 51,668/female 70,603) (2011 est.)"},"Median age":{"total:":{"quantity":26.7,"unit":"years"},"male:":{"quantity":26.3,"unit":"years"},"female:":{"quantity":27.2,"unit":"years"}},"Sex ratio":{"at birth:":{"quantity":1.085,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"under 15 years:":{"quantity":1.09,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"15-64 years:":{"quantity":1.09,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"65 years and over:":{"quantity":0.74,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"total population:":{"quantity":1.06,"unit":"male(s)/female"}},"Nationality":{"noun:":"Kosovar (Albanian), Kosovac (Serbian)","adjective:":"Kosovar (Albanian), Kosovski (Serbian)"},"Ethnic groups":"Albanians 92%, other (Serb, Bosniak, Gorani, Roma, Turk, Ashkali, Egyptian) 8% (2008)","Religions":"Muslim, Serbian Orthodox, Roman Catholic","Languages":"Albanian (official), Serbian (official), Bosnian, Turkish, Roma","Literacy":{"definition:":"age 15 and over can read and write","total population:":{"quantity":91.9,"unit":"%"},"male:":{"quantity":96.6,"unit":"%"},"female:":{"quantity":87.5,"unit":"%"}},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":"NA","Education expenditures":{"quantity":4.3,"unit":"% of GDP"}},"economy":{"Economy - overview":"Over the past few years Kosovo's economy has shown significant progress in transitioning to a market-based system and maintaining macroeconomic stability, but it is still highly dependent on the international community and the diaspora for financial and technical assistance. Remittances from the diaspora - located mainly in Germany, Switzerland, and the Nordic countries - are estimated to account for about 13-15% of GDP, and donor-financed activities and aid for another 7.5%. Kosovo's citizens are the poorest in Europe with an average annual per capita income of only $2,800. Unemployment, around 40% of the population, is a significant problem that encourages outward migration and black market activity. Most of Kosovo's population lives in rural towns outside of the capital, Pristina. Inefficient, near-subsistence farming is common - the result of small plots, limited mechanization, and lack of technical expertise. With international assistance, Kosovo has been able to privatize 50% of its state-owned enterprises (SOEs) by number, and over 90% of SOEs by value. Minerals and metals - including lignite, lead, zinc, nickel, chrome, aluminum, magnesium, and a wide variety of construction materials - once formed the backbone of industry, but output has declined because of ageing equipment and insufficient investment. A limited and unreliable electricity supply due to technical and financial problems is a major impediment to economic development, but Kosovo has received technical assistance to help improve accounting and controls. The US Government is cooperating with the Ministry for Energy and Mines and the World Bank to prepare a commercial tender for a project to include construction of a new power plant and the development of a coal mine to supply the new power plant as well as two existing plants. Privatization of the distribution and supply divisions of Kosovo Energy Corporation is also planned. The official currency of Kosovo is the euro, but the Serbian dinar is also used in Serb enclaves. Kosovo's tie to the euro has helped keep core inflation low. Kosovo has one of the most open economies in the region, and continues to work with the international community on measures to improve the business environment and attract foreign investment. Kosovo has maintained a budget surplus as a result of efficient value added tax (VAT) collection at the borders and inefficient budget execution. In order to help integrate Kosovo into regional economic structures, UNMIK signed (on behalf of Kosovo) its accession to the Central Europe Free Trade Area (CEFTA) in 2006. However, Serbia and Bosnia have refused to recognize Kosovo's customs stamp or extend reduced tariff privileges for Kosovo products under CEFTA. In July 2008, Kosovo received pledges of $1.9 billion from 37 countries in support of its reform priorities. In June 2009, Kosovo joined the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, and Kosovo began servicing its share of the former Yugoslavia's debt.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":11970000000},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":5601000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":4,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":12.9,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":22.6,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":64.5,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":310000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":23.6,"unit":"%"},"industry:":"NA","services:":"NA (2010)"},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":45,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":30,"unit":"%"},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":30,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":35,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":1458000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":1581000000}},"Public debt":"NA% of GDP (2010)","Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":3.5,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":14.4,"unit":"%"},"Agriculture - products":"wheat, corn, berries, potatoes, peppers","Industries":"mineral mining, construction materials, base metals, leather, machinery, appliances","Electricity - production":{"quantity":4777000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":5388000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":"NA bbl/day","Oil - proved reserves":"NA bbl","Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":"NA cu m","Current account balance":"$-2.716 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":527000000},"Exports - commodities":"mining and processed metal products, scrap metals, leather products, machinery, appliances","Imports":"$2.6 billion (2007 est.)

During the 1950s and 1960s agricultural \"Virgin Lands\" program, Soviet citizens were encouraged to help cultivate Kazakhstan's northern pastures. This influx of immigrants (mostly Russians, but also some other deported nationalities) skewed the ethnic mixture and enabled non-ethnic Kazakhs to outnumber natives. Independence in 1991 drove many of these newcomers to emigrate. Kazakhstan's economy is larger than those of all the other Central Asian states largely due to the country's vast natural resources. Current issues include: developing a cohesive national identity; expanding the development of the country's vast energy resources and exporting them to world markets; diversifying the economy outside the oil, gas, and mining sectors;

It also has a large agricultural sector featuring livestock and grain. In 2002 Kazakhstan became the first country in the former Soviet Union to receive an investment-grade credit rating, and from 2000 through 2007, Kazakhstan's economy grew more than 9% per year. Extractive industries, particularly hydrocarbons and mining, have been the engines of this growth. However, geographic limitations and decaying infrastructure present serious obstacles. Landlocked, with restricted access to the high seas, Kazakhstan relies on its neighbors to export its products, especially oil and gas. Although its Caspian Sea ports and rail lines carrying oil have been upgraded, civil aviation has been neglected. Telecoms are improving, but require considerable investment, as does the information technology base. Supply and distribution of electricity can be erratic. At the end of 2007, global financial markets froze up and the loss of capital inflows to Kazakhstani banks caused a credit crunch. The subsequent and sharp fall of oil and commodity prices in 2008 aggravated the economic situation, and Kazakhstan plunged into recession. While the global financial crisis took a significant toll on Kazakhstan's economy, it has rebounded well. In response to the crisis, Kazakhstan's government devalued the tenge (Kazakhstan's currency) to stabilize market pressures and injected $19 billion in economic stimulus. Rising commodity prices have helped revive Kazakhstan's economy, which registered 7% growth in 2010. Barring a dramatic decline in oil prices, strong growth is expected to continue in 2011. Despite solid macroeconomic indicators, the government realizes that its economy suffers from an overreliance on oil and extractive industries, the so-called \"Dutch disease.\" In response, Kazakhstan has embarked on an ambitious diversification program, aimed at developing targeted sectors like transport, pharmaceuticals, telecommunications, petrochemicals and food processing.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":196400000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":138400000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":7,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":5.4,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":42.8,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":51.8,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":8718000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":28.2,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":18.2,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":53.6,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":5.5,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":8.2,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":3.3,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":26.5,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":26.7,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":24.7,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":27500000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":31600000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":16.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":7.8,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":7,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":"NA%","Stock of narrow money":{"usd":15000000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":58000000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":44530000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":57660000000},"Agriculture - products":"grain (mostly spring wheat), cotton; livestock","Industries":"oil, coal, iron ore, manganese, chromite, lead, zinc, copper, titanium, bauxite, gold, silver, phosphates, sulfur, uranium, iron and steel; tractors and other agricultural machinery, electric motors, construction materials","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":7.3,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":78400000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":77900000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":3617000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":1940000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":1540000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":241000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":1345000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":164000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":30000000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":35610000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":33680000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":17660000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":3720000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":2407000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":6993000000},"Exports":{"usd":59230000000},"Exports - commodities":"oil and oil products 59%, ferrous metals 19%, chemicals 5%, machinery 3%, grain, wool, meat, coal","Exports - partners":"China 16.34%, France 9.23%, Germany 8.32%, Russia 6.9%, Ukraine 5.52%, Romania 5.25%, Italy 5.12%, US 4.34% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":30110000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery and equipment, metal products, foodstuffs","Imports - partners":"Russia 28.5%, China 26.72%, Germany 6.59%, Italy 5.58%, Ukraine 4.8% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":32439999999.999996},"Debt - external":{"usd":94440000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":83300000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":7208000000},"Exchange rates":"tenge (KZT) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"la","name":"Laos","region":"East & Southeast Asia","background":"Modern-day Laos has its roots in the ancient Lao kingdom of Lan Xang, established in the 14th Century under King FA NGUM.

The results, starting from an extremely low base, were striking - growth averaged 6% per year from 1988-2008 except during the short-lived drop caused by the Asian financial crisis that began in 1997. Despite this high growth rate, Laos remains a country with an underdeveloped infrastructure, particularly in rural areas. It has a rudimentary, but improving, road system, and limited external and internal telecommunications. China has signed a deal with the Lao to build a high speed rail system in the country. Construction on the $7 billion project is slated to begin in April 2011 and will take five years. Electricity is available in urban areas and in many rural districts. Subsistence agriculture, dominated by rice cultivation in lowland areas, accounts for about 30% of GDP and 75% of total employment. The government in FY09/10 received $586 million from international donors. Economic growth has reduced official poverty rates from 46% in 1992 to 26% in 2010. The economy has benefited from high foreign investment in hydropower, mining, and construction. Laos gained Normal Trade Relations status with the US in 2004, and is taking steps required to join the World Trade Organization, such as reforming import licensing. Related trade policy reforms will improve the business environment. On the fiscal side, Laos initiated a VAT tax system in 2010. Simplified investment procedures and expanded bank credits for small farmers and small entrepreneurs will improve Lao's economic prospects. The government appears committed to raising the country's profile among investors. The World Bank has declared that Laos's goal of graduating from the UN Development Program's list of least-developed countries by 2020 is achievable. According Laotian officials, the 7th Socio-Economic Development Plan for 2011-15 will outline efforts to achieve Millennium Development Goals.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":15690000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":6341000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":7.7,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":29.8,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":31.7,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":38.5,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":3690000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":75.1,"unit":"%"},"industry and services:":"NA (2010 est.)"},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":2.5,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":26,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":3.4,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":28.5,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":34.6,"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":1137000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":1328000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":6,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":4.3,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":26,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":630000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":1818000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":1562000000},"Agriculture - products":"sweet potatoes, vegetables, corn, coffee, sugarcane, tobacco, cotton, tea, peanuts, rice; water buffalo, pigs, cattle, poultry","Industries":"copper, tin, gold, and gypsum mining; timber, electric power, agricultural processing, construction, garments, cement, tourism","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":17.7,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":1553000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":2230000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":341000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":999000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":1918,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":1918,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":"NA cu m (2008 est.)","Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":"NA cu m (2008 est.)","Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-195 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":1950000000},"Exports - commodities":"wood products, coffee, electricity, tin, copper, gold","Exports - partners":"Thailand 29.18%, China 15.04%, Vietnam 14.96%, UK 4.29% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":1504000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery and equipment, vehicles, fuel, consumer goods","Imports - partners":"Thailand 66.2%, China 11.45%, Vietnam 5.3% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":756000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":5797000000},"Exchange rates":"kips (LAK) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"le","name":"Lebanon","region":"Middle East","background":"Following World War I, France acquired a mandate over the northern portion of the former Ottoman Empire province of Syria. The French separated out the region of Lebanon in 1920, and granted this area independence in 1943. A lengthy civil war (1975-90) devastated the country, but Lebanon has since made progress toward rebuilding its political institutions. Under the Ta'if Accord - the blueprint for national reconciliation - the Lebanese established a more equitable political system, particularly by giving Muslims a greater voice in the political process while institutionalizing sectarian divisions in the government. Since the end of the war, Lebanon has conducted several successful elections. Most militias have been reduced or disbanded, with the exception of Hizballah, designated by the US State Department as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, and Palestinian militant groups. During Lebanon's civil war, the Arab League legitimized in the Ta'if Accord Syria's troop deployment, numbering about 16,000 based mainly east of Beirut and in the Bekaa Valley. Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon in May 2000 and the passage in September 2004 of UNSCR 1559 - a resolution calling for Syria to withdraw from Lebanon and end its interference in Lebanese affairs - encouraged some Lebanese groups to demand that Syria withdraw its forces as well. The assassination of former Prime Minister Rafiq HARIRI and 22 others in February 2005 led to massive demonstrations in Beirut against the Syrian presence (\"the Cedar Revolution\"), and Syria withdrew the remainder of its military forces in April 2005. In May-June 2005, Lebanon held its first legislative elections since the end of the civil war free of foreign interference, handing a majority to the bloc led by Sa'ad HARIRI, the slain prime minister's son. In July 2006, Hizballah kidnapped two Israeli soldiers leading to a 34-day conflict with Israel in which approximately 1,200 Lebanese civilians were killed. UNSCR 1701 ended the war in August 2006, and Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) deployed throughout the country for the first time in decades, charged with securing Lebanon's borders against weapons smuggling and maintaining a weapons-free zone in south Lebanon with the help of the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). The LAF in May-September 2007 battled Sunni extremist group Fatah al-Islam in the Nahr al-Barid Palestinian refugee camp, winning a decisive victory, but destroying the camp and displacing 30,000 Palestinian residents. Lebanese politicians in November 2007 were unable to agree on a successor to Emile LAHUD when he stepped down as president, creating a political vacuum until the election of LAF Commander Gen. Michel SULAYMAN in May 2008 and the formation of a new unity government in July 2008. Legislative elections in June 2009 again produced victory for the bloc led by Sa'ad HARIRI, but a period of prolonged negotiation over the composition of the cabinet ensued. A national unity government was finally formed in November 2009 and approved by the National Assembly the following month. In January 2010, Lebanon assumed a nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council for the 2010-11 term. Inspired by the popular revolts that began in late 2010 against dictatorships across the Middle East and North Africa, marches and demonstrations in Lebanon were directed instead against sectarian politics. Protesters saw the country's religious sectarian politics as the primary cause of Lebanon's anemic government.  The first protests in late February 2011, although limited in size, gained some traction.","geo":{"Location":"Middle East, bordering the Mediterranean Sea, between Israel and Syria","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":33,"min":50},"E":{"deg":35,"min":50}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total:":{"quantity":10400,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world:":"","land:":{"quantity":10230,"unit":"sq km"},"water:":{"quantity":170,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"about 0.7 times the size of Connecticut","Land boundaries":{"total:":{"quantity":454,"unit":"km"},"border countries:":"Israel 79 km, Syria 375 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":225,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea:":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"}},"Climate":"Mediterranean;

The government does not restrict foreign investment; however, the investment climate suffers from red tape, corruption, arbitrary licensing decisions, high taxes, tariffs, and fees, archaic legislation, and weak intellectual property rights. The Lebanese economy is service-oriented; main growth sectors include banking and tourism. The 1975-90 civil war seriously damaged Lebanon's economic infrastructure, cut national output by half, and all but ended Lebanon's position as a Middle Eastern entrepot and banking hub. In the years since, Lebanon has rebuilt much of its war-torn physical and financial infrastructure by borrowing heavily - mostly from domestic banks. In an attempt to reduce the ballooning national debt, the Rafiq HARIRI government in 2000 began an austerity program, reining in government expenditures, increasing revenue collection, and passing legislation to privatize state enterprises, but economic and financial reform initiatives stalled and public debt continued to grow despite receipt of more than $2 billion in bilateral assistance at the 2002 Paris II Donors Conference. The Israeli-Hizballah conflict in July-August 2006 caused an estimated $3.6 billion in infrastructure damage, and prompted international donors to pledge nearly $1 billion in recovery and reconstruction assistance. Donors met again in January 2007 at the Paris III Donor Conference and pledged more than $7.5 billion to Lebanon for development projects and budget support, conditioned on progress on Beirut's fiscal reform and privatization program. An 18-month political stalemate and sporadic sectarian and political violence hampered economic activity, particularly tourism, retail sales, and investment, until the new government was formed in July 2008. Political stability following the Doha Accord of May 2008 helped boost tourism and, together with a strong banking sector, enabled real GDP growth of 7% per year in 2009-10 despite a slowdown in the region.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":59370000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":39250000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":7.5,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":5.1,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":15.9,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":79,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":{"Labor force":1481000,"country comparison to the world:":""},"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":"NA%","industry:":"NA%","services:":"NA%"},"Unemployment rate":"NA%","Population below poverty line":{"quantity":28,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":"NA%","highest 10%:":"NA%"},"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":30.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":9001000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":10950000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":150.7,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":3.7,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":10,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":9.57,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":3692000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":92010000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":62680000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":12890000000},"Agriculture - products":"citrus, grapes, tomatoes, apples, vegetables, potatoes, olives, tobacco; sheep, goats","Industries":"banking, tourism, food processing, wine, jewelry, cement, textiles, mineral and chemical products, wood and furniture products, oil refining, metal fabricating","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":2.1,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":10410000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":9793000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":1114000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":90000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":86750,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-6.972 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":5187000000},"Exports - commodities":"jewelry, base metals, chemicals, miscellaneous consumer goods, fruit and vegetables, tobacco, construction minerals, electric power machinery and switchgear, textile fibers, paper","Exports - partners":"Switzerland 22%, UAE 10%, Iraq 8%, Saudi Arabia 7%, Syria 6% (2009 est.)","Imports":{"usd":17970000000},"Imports - commodities":"petroleum products, cars, medicinal products, clothing, meat and live animals, consumer goods, paper, textile fabrics, tobacco, electrical machinery and equipment, chemicals","Imports - partners":"US 11%, France 10%, China 9%, Italy 8%, Germany 8%, Turkey 4% (2009 est.)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":41570000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":34450000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":"$NA","Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA","Exchange rates":"Lebanese pounds (LBP) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"lg","name":"Latvia","region":"Europe","background":"The name \"Latvia\" originates from the ancient Latgalians, one of four eastern Baltic tribes that formed the ethnic core of the Latvian people (ca. 8th-12th centuries A.D.).

Due to its geographical location, transit services are highly-developed, along with timber and wood-processing, agriculture and food products, and manufacturing of machinery and electronic devices. The bulk of the country's economic activity, however, is in the services sector. Corruption continues to be an impediment to attracting FDI flows and Latvia's low birth rate and decreasing population are major challenges to its long-term economic vitality. Latvia's economy experienced GDP growth of more than 10% per year during 2006-07, but entered a severe recession in 2008 as a result of an unsustainable current account deficit and large debt exposure amid the softening world economy. GDP plunged 18% in 2009 - the three Baltic states had the world's worst declines that year. Thanks to strong export growth in 2009 and 2010, the economy experienced its first real quarterly GDP growth in over two years (2.9%) in the third quarter of 2010. The IMF, EU, and other international donors provided substantial financial assistance to Latvia as part of an agreement to defend the currency's peg to the euro. This agreement calls for reduction of Latvia's fiscal deficit to below 3% of GDP by 2012, in order to meet the Maastricht Treaty criteria for euro adoption. DOMBROVSKIS' government enacted major spending cuts to reduce the fiscal deficit to a maximum of 8.5% of GDP in 2010, and Latvia has approved a 2011 budget with a projected deficit of 5.4% of GDP. The majority of companies, banks, and real estate have been privatized, although the state still holds sizable stakes in a few large enterprises. Latvia officially joined the World Trade Organization in February, 1999. EU membership, a top foreign policy goal, came in May 2004. Latvia's current major financial policy goal, entrance into the euro zone, is targeted for 2014.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":32509999999.999996},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":24050000000},"GDP - real growth rate":"-0.3% (2010 est.)","GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":4.2,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":20.6,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":75.2,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":1178000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":12.1,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":25.8,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":61.8,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":14.3,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":2.7,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":27.4,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":36,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":15.7,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":8028000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":9863000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":46.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":"-1.2% (2010 est.)","Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":4,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":16.23,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":5769000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":11170000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":27590000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":1824000000},"Agriculture - products":"grain, rapeseed, potatoes, vegetables; pork, poultry, milk, eggs; fish","Industries":"processed foods, processed wood products, textiles, processed metals, pharmaceuticals, railroad cars, synthetic fibers, electronics","Industrial production growth rate":"-1.8% (2010 est.)","Electricity - production":{"quantity":4620000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":6822000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":2123000000.0000002,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":4643000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":40000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":5873,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":43400,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":1527000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":1743000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":1620000000},"Exports":{"usd":7894000000},"Exports - commodities":"food products, wood and wood products, metals, machinery and equipment, textiles","Exports - partners":"Lithuania 15.19%, Estonia 13.57%, Russia 13.17%, Germany 8.13%, Sweden 5.7% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":9153000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery and equipment, consumer goods, chemicals, fuels, vehicles","Imports - partners":"Lithuania 16.36%, Germany 11.34%, Russia 10.68%, Poland 8.11%, Estonia 7.69% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":7170000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":37280000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":11710000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":1097000000},"Exchange rates":"lati (LVL) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"lh","name":"Lithuania","region":"Europe","background":"Lithuanian lands were united under MINDAUGAS in 1236; over the next century, through alliances and conquest, Lithuania extended its territory to include most of present-day Belarus and Ukraine.

In 1980, a military coup led by Samuel DOE ushered in a decade of authoritarian rule. In December 1989, Charles TAYLOR launched a rebellion against DOE's regime that led to a prolonged civil war in which DOE himself was killed. A period of relative peace in 1997 allowed for elections that brought TAYLOR to power, but major fighting resumed in 2000. An August 2003 peace agreement ended the war and prompted the resignation of former president Charles TAYLOR, who faces war crimes charges in The Hague related to his involvement in Sierra Leone's civil war.

The UN Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) maintains a strong presence throughout the country, but the security situation is still fragile and the process of rebuilding the social and economic structure of this war-torn country continues.","geo":{"Location":"Western Africa, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean, between Cote d'Ivoire and Sierra Leone","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":6,"min":30},"W":{"deg":9,"min":30}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total:":{"quantity":111369,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world:":"","land:":{"quantity":96320,"unit":"sq km"},"water:":{"quantity":15049,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly larger than Tennessee","Land boundaries":{"total:":{"quantity":1585,"unit":"km"},"border countries:":"Guinea 563 km, Cote d'Ivoire 716 km, Sierra Leone 306 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":579,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea:":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"}},"Climate":"tropical;

Many businesses fled the country, taking capital and expertise with them, but with the conclusion of fighting and the installation of a democratically-elected government in 2006, several have returned. Liberia has the distinction of having the highest ratio of direct foreign investment to GDP in the world. Richly endowed with water, mineral resources, forests, and a climate favorable to agriculture, Liberia had been a producer and exporter of basic products, primarily raw timber and rubber and is reviving those sectors. Local manufacturing, mainly foreign owned, had been small in scope. President JOHNSON SIRLEAF, a Harvard-trained banker and administrator, has taken steps to reduce corruption, build support from international donors, and encourage private investment. Embargos on timber and diamond exports have been lifted, opening new sources of revenue for the government and Liberia shipped its first major timber exports to Europe in 2010. The country reached its Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative completion point in 2010 and nearly $5 billion of international debt was permanently eliminated. This new status will enable Liberia to establish a sovereign credit rating and issue bonds. Liberia's Paris Club creditors agreed to cancel Liberia's debt as well. Rebuilding infrastructure and raising incomes will depend on generous financial and technical assistance from donor countries and foreign investment in key sectors, such as infrastructure and power generation.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":1691000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":974000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":5.1,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":76.9,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":5.4,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":17.7,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":1372000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":70,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":8,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":22,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":85,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":80,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":2.4,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":30.1,"unit":"%"}},"Budget":{"revenues:":"$NA","expenditures:":"$NA"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":11.2,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":14.4,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":206900000},"Stock of broad money":"$NA","Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":1202000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Agriculture - products":"rubber, coffee, cocoa, rice, cassava (tapioca), palm oil, sugarcane, bananas; sheep, goats; timber","Industries":"rubber processing, palm oil processing, timber, diamonds","Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Electricity - production":{"quantity":350000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":325500000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":4000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":23.37,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":4263,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-224 million (2007)","Exports":{"usd":1197000000},"Exports - commodities":"rubber, timber, iron, diamonds, cocoa, coffee","Exports - partners":"Germany 27.92%, Poland 17.12%, South Africa 15.83%, India 10.48%, Greece 7.09%, US 6.23%, Norway 5.24% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":7143000000},"Imports - commodities":"fuels, chemicals, machinery, transportation equipment, manufactured goods; foodstuffs","Imports - partners":"South Korea 28.29%, Singapore 19.06%, Japan 17.06%, China 14.58%, Taiwan 4.02% (2009)","Debt - external":{"usd":3200000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":"$NA","Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA","Exchange rates":"Liberian dollars (LRD) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"lo","name":"Slovakia","region":"Europe","background":"Slovakia's roots can be traced to the 9th century state of Great Moravia.

Reforms to the taxation, healthcare, pension, and social welfare systems helped Slovakia consolidate its budget and get on track to join the EU in 2004 and to adopt the euro in January 2009. Major privatizations are nearly complete, the banking sector is almost entirely in foreign hands, and the government has helped facilitate a foreign investment boom with business friendly policies. Slovakia's economic growth exceeded expectations in 2001-08 despite a general European slowdown. Unemployment, at an unacceptable 18% in 2003-04, dropped to 7.7% in 2008 but remains the economy's Achilles heel. Foreign direct investment (FDI) accounted for much of the growth until 2008. Cheap and skilled labor, low taxes, a 19% flat tax for corporations and individuals, no dividend taxes, a relatively liberal labor code and a favorable geographical location are Slovakia's main advantages for foreign investors. Foreign investment in the automotive and electronic sectors has been especially strong. To maintain a stable operating environment for investors, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development advised the Slovak government to refrain from intervening in important sectors of the economy. However, Bratislava's approach to mitigating the economic slowdown has included substantial government intervention and the option to nationalize strategic companies. RADICOVA's government, in power since July 2010, has allowed the budget deficit to rise slightly, to 7.4% of GDP in 2010. GDP fell nearly 5% in 2009 before gaining back 4% in 2010, and unemployment rose above 12% in 2010, as the global recession impacted many segments of the economy.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":120200000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":87450000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":4,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":2.7,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":35.6,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":61.8,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":2673000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":3.5,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":27,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":69.4,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":13.5,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":21,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":3.1,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":20.9,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":26,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":22.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":28450000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":35010000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":41,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":1,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":"NA%","Stock of narrow money":{"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":34370000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":52630000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":65090000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":4672000000},"Agriculture - products":"grains, potatoes, sugar beets, hops, fruit; pigs, cattle, poultry; forest products","Industries":"metal and metal products; food and beverages; electricity, gas, coke, oil, nuclear fuel; chemicals and manmade fibers; machinery; paper and printing; earthenware and ceramics; transport vehicles; textiles; electrical and optical apparatus; rubber products","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":7.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":25900000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":28750000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":8891000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":9412000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":4114,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":79930,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":75110,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":144000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":9000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":103000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":6493000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":15000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":6974000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":14160000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-1.93 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":64180000000.00001},"Exports - commodities":"machinery and electrical equipment 35.9%, vehicles 21%, base metals 11.3%, chemicals and minerals 8.1%, plastics 4.9% (2009 est.)","Exports - partners":"Germany 20.1%, Czech Republic 12.9%, France 7.8%, Poland 7.2%, Hungary 6.3%, Italy 6.1%, Austria 5.8%, UK 4.8% (2009 est.)","Imports":{"usd":62430000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery and transport equipment 31%, mineral products 13%, vehicles 12%, base metals 9%, chemicals 8%, plastics 6% (2009 est.)","Imports - partners":"Germany 16.8%, Czech Republic 12.3%, Russia 9%, South Korea 6.8%, China 5.8%, Hungary 5.3%, Poland 4% (2009 est.)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":1160000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":59330000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":52200000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":2643000000},"Exchange rates":"Slovak koruny (SKK) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"ls","name":"Liechtenstein","region":"Europe","background":"The Principality of Liechtenstein was established within the Holy Roman Empire in 1719.

The Liechtenstein economy is widely diversified with a large number of small businesses. Low business taxes - the maximum tax rate is 20% - and easy incorporation rules have induced many holding companies to establish nominal offices in Liechtenstein providing 30% of state revenues. The country participates in a customs union with Switzerland and uses the Swiss franc as its national currency. It imports more than 90% of its energy requirements. Liechtenstein has been a member of the European Economic Area (an organization serving as a bridge between the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and the EU) since May 1995. The government is working to harmonize its economic policies with those of an integrated Europe. In 2008, Liechtenstein came under renewed international pressure - particularly from Germany - to improve transparency in its banking and tax systems. In December 2008, Liechtenstein signed a Tax Information Exchange Agreement with the US. Upon Liechtenstein's conclusion of 12 bilateral information-sharing agreements, the OECD in October 2009 removed the principality from its \"grey list\" of countries that had yet to implement the organization's Model Tax Convention. By the end of 2010, Liechtenstein had signed 25 Tax Information Exchange Agreements or Double Tax Agreements.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":5028000000},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":5080000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":1.8,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":6,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":36,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":58,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":{"Labor force":32880,"country comparison to the world:":""},"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":1.5,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":43.5,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":55,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":1.5,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":"NA%","highest 10%:":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":943000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":820000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":0.7,"unit":"%"},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Agriculture - products":"wheat, barley, corn, potatoes; livestock, dairy products","Industries":"electronics, metal manufacturing, dental products, ceramics, pharmaceuticals, food products, precision instruments, tourism, optical instruments","Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Exports":{"usd":2830000000},"Exports - commodities":"small specialty machinery, connectors for audio and video, parts for motor vehicles, dental products, hardware, prepared foodstuffs, electronic equipment, optical products","Imports":{"usd":1770000000},"Imports - commodities":"agricultural products, raw materials, energy products, machinery, metal goods, textiles, foodstuffs, motor vehicles","Debt - external":{"usd":null},"Exchange rates":"Swiss francs (CHF) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"lt","name":"Lesotho","region":"Africa","background":"Basutoland was renamed the Kingdom of Lesotho upon independence from the UK in 1966.

However, the government has recently strengthened its tax system to reduce dependency on customs duties. Completion of a major hydropower facility in January 1998 permitted the sale of water to South Africa and generated royalties for Lesotho. Lesotho produces about 90% of its own electrical power needs. As the number of mineworkers has declined steadily over the past several years, a small manufacturing base has developed based on farm products that support the milling, canning, leather, and jute industries, as well as an apparel-assembly sector. Despite Lesotho's market-based economy being heavily tied to its neighbor South Africa, the US is an important trade partner because of the export sector's heavy dependence on apparel exports. Exports have grown significantly because of the trade benefits contained in the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act. Most of the labor force is engaged in subsistence agriculture, especially livestock herding, although drought has decreased agricultural activity. The extreme inequality in the distribution of income remains a major drawback. Lesotho has signed an Interim Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility with the IMF. In July 2007, Lesotho signed a Millennium Challenge Account Compact with the US worth $362.5 million. Economic growth dropped in 2009, due mainly to the effects of the global economic crisis as demand for the country's exports declined and SACU revenue fell precipitously when South Africa - the primary contributor to the SACU revenue pool - went into recession, but growth returned to 3.5% in 2010.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":3303000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":2126999999.9999998},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":2.4,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":7.1,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":34.6,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":58.2,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":854600,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":"86% of resident population engaged in subsistence agriculture; roughly 35% of the active male wage earners work in South Africa","industry and services:":{"quantity":14,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":45,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":49,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":1,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":39.4,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":63.2,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":21.9,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":968400000},"expenditures:":{"usd":1193000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":6.1,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":10.66,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":13,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":653300000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":1056999999.9999999},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":177700000},"Agriculture - products":"corn, wheat, pulses, sorghum, barley; livestock","Industries":"food, beverages, textiles, apparel assembly, handicrafts, construction, tourism","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"Electricity - production":{"quantity":502000000,"unit":"kWh"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":516900000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":"50 million kWh; note - electricity supplied by South Africa (2008 est.)","Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":2000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":1553,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-125 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":985000000},"Exports - commodities":"manufactures 75% (clothing, footwear, road vehicles), wool and mohair, food and live animals","Exports - partners":"US 58.9%, Belgium 37%, Madagascar 1.2% (2008)","Imports":{"usd":1766000000},"Imports - commodities":"food; building materials, vehicles, machinery, medicines, petroleum products","Imports - partners":"China 26.3%, Taiwan 20.1%, Hong Kong 16.4%, South Korea 14.1%, India 9.2% (2008)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":893000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":647000000},"Exchange rates":"maloti (LSL) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"lu","name":"Luxembourg","region":"Europe","background":"Founded in 963, Luxembourg became a grand duchy in 1815 and an independent state under the Netherlands.

The industrial sector, initially dominated by steel, has become increasingly diversified to include chemicals, rubber, and other products. Growth in the financial sector, which now accounts for about 28% of GDP, has more than compensated for the decline in steel. Most banks are foreign owned and have extensive foreign dealings, but Luxembourg has lost some of its advantages as a tax haven because of OECD and EU pressure. The economy depends on foreign and cross-border workers for about 60% of its labor force. Luxembourg, like all EU members, suffered from the global economic crisis that began in late 2008, but unemployment has trended below the EU average. Following strong expansion from 2004 to 2007, Luxembourg's economy contracted and 3.7% in 2009, but rebounded 3.2% in 2010. The country continues to enjoy an extraordinarily high standard of living - GDP per capita ranks third in the world, after Liechtenstein and Qatar, and is the highest in the EU. Turmoil in the world financial markets and lower global demand during 2008-09 prompted the government to inject capital into the banking sector and implement stimulus measures to boost the economy. Government stimulus measures and support for the banking sector, however, led to a 5% government budget deficit in 2009.

Libya then passed to UN administration and achieved independence in 1951. Following a 1969 military coup, Col. Muammar Abu Minyar al-QADHAFI began to espouse his own political system, the Third Universal Theory. The system is a combination of socialism and Islam derived in part from tribal practices and is supposed to be implemented by the Libyan people themselves in a unique form of \"direct democracy.\" QADHAFI has always seen himself as a revolutionary and visionary leader. He used oil funds during the 1970s and 1980s to promote his ideology outside Libya, supporting subversives and terrorists abroad to hasten the end of Marxism and capitalism. In addition, beginning in 1973, he engaged in military operations in northern Chad's Aozou Strip - to gain access to minerals and to use as a base of influence in Chadian politics - but was forced to retreat in 1987. UN sanctions in 1992 isolated QADHAFI politically following the downing of Pan AM Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. During the 1990s, QADHAFI began to rebuild his relationships with Europe. UN sanctions were suspended in April 1999 and finally lifted in September 2003 after Libya accepted responsibility for the Lockerbie bombing. In December 2003, Libya announced that it had agreed to reveal and end its programs to develop weapons of mass destruction and to renounce terrorism. QADHAFI subsequently made significant strides in normalizing relations with Western nations. He hosted various Western European leaders as well as many working-level and commercial delegations, and made his first trip to Western Europe in 15 years when he traveled to Brussels in April 2004. The US rescinded Libya's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism in June 2006. In August 2008, the US and Libya signed a bilateral comprehensive claims settlement agreement to compensate claimants in both countries who allege injury or death at the hands of the other country, including the Lockerbie bombing, the LaBelle disco bombing, and the UTA 772 bombing. In October 2008, the US Government received $1.5 billion pursuant to the agreement to distribute to US national claimants, and as a result effectively normalized its bilateral relationship with Libya. The two countries then exchanged ambassadors for the first time since 1973 in January 2009. Libya in May 2010 was elected to its first three-year seat on the UN Human Rights Council, prompting protests from international non-governmental organizations and human rights campaigners. Unrest that began in several Near Eastern and North African countries in late December 2010 spread to several Libyan cities in February 2011.

The weakness in world hydrocarbon prices in 2009 reduced Libyan government tax income and constrained economic growth. Substantial revenues from the energy sector coupled with a small population give Libya one of the highest per capita GDPs in Africa, but little of this income flows down to the lower orders of society. Libyan officials in the past five years have made progress on economic reforms as part of a broader campaign to reintegrate the country into the international fold. This effort picked up steam after UN sanctions were lifted in September 2003 and as Libya announced in December 2003 that it would abandon programs to build weapons of mass destruction. The process of lifting US unilateral sanctions began in the spring of 2004; all sanctions were removed by June 2006, helping Libya attract greater foreign direct investment, especially in the energy sector. Libyan oil and gas licensing rounds continue to draw high international interest; the National Oil Corporation (NOC) set a goal of nearly doubling oil production to 3 million bbl/day by 2012. In November 2009, the NOC announced that that target may slip to as late as 2017. Libya faces a long road ahead in liberalizing the socialist-oriented economy, but initial steps - including applying for WTO membership, reducing some subsidies, and announcing plans for privatization - are laying the groundwork for a transition to a more market-based economy. The non-oil manufacturing and construction sectors, which account for more than 20% of GDP, have expanded from processing mostly agricultural products to include the production of petrochemicals, iron, steel, and aluminum. Climatic conditions and poor soils severely limit agricultural output, and Libya imports about 75% of its food. Libya's primary agricultural water source remains the Great Manmade River Project, but significant resources are being invested in desalinization research to meet growing water demands.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":90570000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":74230000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":4.2,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":2.6,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":63.8,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":33.6,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":1729000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":17,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":23,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":59,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":30,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"Population below poverty line":"NA"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":"NA%","highest 10%:":"NA%"},"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":13.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":42310000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":38920000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":3.3,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":4,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":8.41,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":29850000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":35980000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":55030000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Agriculture - products":"wheat, barley, olives, dates, citrus, vegetables, peanuts, soybeans; cattle","Industries":"petroleum, petrochemicals, aluminum, iron and steel, food processing, textiles, handicrafts, cement","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":2.7,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":23980000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":22170000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":104000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":77000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":1790000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":280000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":1542000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":575.3,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":47000000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":15900000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":5500000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":10400000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":1539000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":15530000000},"Exports":{"usd":44890000000},"Exports - commodities":"crude oil, refined petroleum products, natural gas, chemicals","Exports - partners":"Italy 37.65%, Germany 10.11%, France 8.44%, Spain 7.94%, Switzerland 5.93%, US 5.27% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":24470000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery, semi-finished goods, food, transport equipment, consumer products","Imports - partners":"Italy 18.9%, China 10.54%, Turkey 9.92%, Germany 9.78%, France 5.63%, Tunisia 5.25%, South Korea 4.02% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":107300000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":6378000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":18640000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":15320000000},"Exchange rates":"Libyan dinars (LYD) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"ma","name":"Madagascar","region":"Africa","background":"Formerly an independent kingdom, Madagascar became a French colony in 1896 but regained independence in 1960.

This strategy placed the country on a slow and steady growth path from an extremely low level. Agriculture, including fishing and forestry, is a mainstay of the economy, accounting for more than one-fourth of GDP and employing 80% of the population. Exports of apparel have boomed in recent years primarily due to duty-free access to the US. However, Madagascar's failure to comply with the requirements of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) led to the termination of the country's duty-free access in January 2010. Deforestation and erosion, aggravated by the use of firewood as the primary source of fuel, are serious concerns. Former President RAVALOMANANA worked aggressively to revive the economy following the 2002 political crisis, which triggered a 12% drop in GDP that year. The current political crisis which began in early 2009 has dealt additional blows to the economy. Tourism dropped more than 50% in 2009, compared with the previous year, and many investors are wary of entering the uncertain investment environment.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":19410000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":8345000000.000001},"GDP - real growth rate":"-2% (2010 est.)","GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":26.5,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":16.7,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":56.8,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":9504000,"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":50,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":2.6,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":41.5,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":47.5,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":34.6,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":896900000},"expenditures:":{"usd":1547000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":8.1,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":"NA%","Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":45,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":1233000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":2012000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":1020000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Agriculture - products":"coffee, vanilla, sugarcane, cloves, cocoa, rice, cassava (tapioca), beans, bananas, peanuts; livestock products","Industries":"meat processing, seafood, soap, breweries, tanneries, sugar, textiles, glassware, cement, automobile assembly plant, paper, petroleum, tourism","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":2,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":1044999999.9999999,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":971400000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":21000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":364.9,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":16940,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-600 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":1412000000},"Exports - commodities":"coffee, vanilla, shellfish, sugar, cotton cloth, chromite, petroleum products","Exports - partners":"France 28.9%, US 20.49%, Germany 5.89%, China 4.36% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":1958000000},"Imports - commodities":"capital goods, petroleum, consumer goods, food","Imports - partners":"China 12.99%, Thailand 11.93%, Bahrain 7.1%, France 6.89%, US 4.13% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":1038000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":2973000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":"$NA","Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA","Exchange rates":"Malagasy ariary (MGA) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"mc","name":"Macau","region":"East & Southeast Asia","background":"Colonized by the Portuguese in the 16th century, Macau was the first European settlement in the Far East.

After opening up its locally-controlled casino industry to foreign competition in 2001, the territory attracted tens of billions of dollars in foreign investment, transforming Macau into one of the world's largest gaming center. Macau's gaming and tourism businesses were fueled by China's decision to relax travel restrictions on Chinese citizens wishing to visit Macau. By 2006, Macau's gaming revenue surpassed that of the Las Vegas strip, and gaming-related taxes accounted for more than 70% of total government revenue. In 2008, Macau introduced measures to cool the rapidly developing sector. This city of nearly 552,300 hosted nearly 25 million visitors in 2010. Almost 53% came from mainland China. Macau's traditional manufacturing industry has virtually disappeared since the termination of the Multi-Fiber Agreement in 2005. In 2010, total exports were less than US$900 million, while gaming receipts were almost US$24 billion, a 58% increase over 2009. The Macau government plans to tighten control over the opening of new casinos and strengthen supervision of local casino operations in 2011 and has introduced measures to diversify the economy. The Closer Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) between Macau and mainland China that came into effect on 1 January 2004 offers Macau-made products tariff-free access to the mainland; nevertheless, China is Macau's second largest goods export market, behind Hong Kong, and followed by the United States. Macau's currency, the pataca, is closely tied to the Hong Kong dollar, which is also freely accepted in the territory.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":18470000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":22100000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":1,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":0.1,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":2.8,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":97.1,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":330900,"Labor force - by occupation":{"manufacturing:":{"quantity":4.3,"unit":"%"},"construction:":{"quantity":8.7,"unit":"%"},"transport and communications:":{"quantity":5.5,"unit":"%"},"wholesale and retail trade:":{"quantity":13.3,"unit":"%"},"restaurants and hotels:":{"quantity":12.7,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":2.9,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":"NA%","highest 10%:":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":9950000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":7180000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":2.8,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":5.25,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":4340000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":30410000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":16329999999.999998},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":46100000000},"Agriculture - products":"only 2% of land area is cultivated, mainly by vegetable growers; fishing, mostly for crustaceans, is important; some of the catch is exported to Hong Kong","Industries":"tourism, gambling, clothing, textiles, electronics, footwear, toys","Industrial production growth rate":"-23.7%","Electricity - production":{"quantity":1100000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":3660000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":2790000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":6490,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":6284,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":154700000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":154500000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":174000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":6230000000},"Exports":{"Exports":{"usd":870000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Exports - commodities":"clothing, textiles, footwear, toys, electronics, machinery and parts","Exports - partners":"Hong Kong 38.7%, US 17.9%, China 14.4%, Germany 4% (2009 est.)","Imports":{"usd":5500000000},"Imports - commodities":"raw materials and semi-manufactured goods, consumer goods (foodstuffs, beverages, tobacco), capital goods, mineral fuels and oils","Imports - partners":"China 31.1%, Hong Kong 10.8%, Japan 8.1%, France 8%, US 6.2% (2009 est.)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":23730000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":null},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":12100000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":240000000},"Exchange rates":"patacas (MOP) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"md","name":"Moldova","region":"Europe","background":"Part of Romania during the interwar period, Moldova was incorporated into the Soviet Union at the close of World War II.

One of the poorest nations in Europe, Moldova became the first former Soviet state to elect a Communist, Vladimir VORONIN, as its president in 2001. VORONIN served as Moldova's president until he resigned in September 2009, following the opposition's gain of a narrow majority in July parliamentary elections and the Communist Party's (PCRM) subsequent inability to attract the three-fifths of parliamentary votes required to elect a president. Moldova's four opposition parties formed a new coalition, the Alliance for European Integration (AIE), which acted as Moldova's governing coalition until December 2010. Moldova experienced significant political uncertainty in 2009 and 2010, holding three general elections (in April 2009, July 2009, and November 2010) and four presidential ballots in parliament, all of which failed to secure a president. Following the November 2010 parliamentary elections, a reconstituted AIE-coalition of three parties formed a government, but remains two votes short of the three-fifths majority required to elect a president. \r\n","geo":{"Location":"Eastern Europe, northeast of Romania","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":47,"min":0},"E":{"deg":29,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total:":{"quantity":33851,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world:":"","land:":{"quantity":32891,"unit":"sq km"},"water:":{"quantity":960,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly larger than Maryland","Land boundaries":{"total:":{"quantity":1390,"unit":"km"},"border countries:":"Romania 450 km, Ukraine 940 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":"none (landlocked)","Climate":"moderate winters, warm summers","Terrain":"rolling steppe, gradual slope south to Black Sea","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point:":"Dniester (Nistru) 2 m","highest point:":"Dealul Balanesti 430 m"},"Natural resources":"lignite, phosphorites, gypsum, arable land, limestone","Land use":{"arable land:":{"quantity":54.52,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops:":{"quantity":8.81,"unit":"%"},"other:":{"quantity":36.67,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":2283,"unit":"sq km"},"Total renewable water resources":{"quantity":11.7,"unit":"cu km"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total:":{"quantity":2.31,"unit":"cu km/yr"},"per capita:":{"quantity":549,"unit":"cu m/yr"}},"Natural hazards":"landslides","Environment - current issues":"heavy use of agricultural chemicals, including banned pesticides such as DDT, has contaminated soil and groundwater;

It enjoys a favorable climate and good farmland but has no major mineral deposits. As a result, the economy depends heavily on agriculture, featuring fruits, vegetables, wine, and tobacco. Moldova must import almost all of its energy supplies. Moldova's dependence on Russian energy was underscored at the end of 2005, when a Russian-owned electrical station in Moldova's separatist Transnistria region cut off power to Moldova and Russia's Gazprom cut off natural gas in disputes over pricing. In January 2009, gas supplies were cut during a dispute between Russia and Ukraine. Russia's decision to ban Moldovan wine and agricultural products, coupled with its decision to double the price Moldova paid for Russian natural gas, have hurt growth. The onset of the global financial crisis and poor economic conditions in Moldova's main foreign markets caused GDP to fall 6% in 2009. Unemployment almost doubled and inflation disappeared - at -0.1%, a record low. Moldova's IMF agreement expired in May 2009. In fall 2009, the IMF allocated $186 million to Moldova to cover its immediate budgetary needs, and the government signed a new agreement with the IMF in January 2010 for a program worth $574 million. In 2010, an upturn in the world economy boosted GDP growth to 6.5% and inflation to 7.3%. Economic reforms have been slow because of corruption and strong political forces backing government controls. Nevertheless, the government's primary goal of EU integration has resulted in some market-oriented progress. The granting of EU trade preferences and increased exports to Russia will encourage higher growth rates, but the agreements are unlikely to serve as a panacea, given the extent to which export success depends on higher quality standards and other factors. The economy has made a modest recovery, but remains vulnerable to political uncertainty, weak administrative capacity, vested bureaucratic interests, higher fuel prices, poor agricultural weather, and the skepticism of foreign investors as well as the presence of an illegal separatist regime in Moldova's Transnistria region.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":10990000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":5810000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":6.9,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":16.3,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":20.1,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":63.6,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":1203000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":40.6,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":16,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":43.3,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":6.5,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":26.3,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":28.2,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":37.4,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":21.7,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":2164000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":2462000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":25,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":7.3,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":20.54,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":1293000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":2037999999.9999998},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":2097000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":573900000},"Agriculture - products":"vegetables, fruits, grapes, grain, sugar beets, sunflower seed, tobacco; beef, milk; wine","Industries":"sugar, vegetable oil, food processing, agricultural machinery; foundry equipment, refrigerators and freezers, washing machines; hosiery, shoes, textiles","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":7,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":3617000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":4370000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":240000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":2931000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":19000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":36.49,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":14230,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":60000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":3176000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":3176000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-565 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":1450000000},"Exports - commodities":"foodstuffs, textiles, machinery","Exports - partners":"Russia 23.77%, Italy 14.11%, Romania 12.74%, Germany 6.92%, Turkey 6.08%, Belarus 5.38% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":3660000000},"Imports - commodities":"mineral products and fuel, machinery and equipment, chemicals, textiles","Imports - partners":"Ukraine 19.9%, Romania 15.1%, Russia 14.52%, Germany 8.69%, Italy 5.7%, Belarus 4.38% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":1710000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":4618000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":2649000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":62440000},"Exchange rates":"Moldovan lei (MDL) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"mf","name":"Mayotte","region":"Africa","background":"Mayotte was ceded to France along with the other islands of the Comoros group in 1843.

Severe winters and summer droughts in 2000-02 resulted in massive livestock die-off and zero or negative GDP growth. This was compounded by falling prices for Mongolia's primary sector exports and widespread opposition to privatization. Growth averaged nearly 9% per year in 2004-08 largely because of high copper prices and new gold production. In 2008 Mongolia experienced a soaring inflation rate with year-to-year inflation reaching nearly 30% - the highest inflation rate in over a decade. By late 2008, as the country began to feel the effects of the global financial crisis, falling commodity prices helped lower inflation, but also reduced government revenues and forced cuts in spending. In early 2009, the International Monetary Fund reached a $236 million Stand-by Arrangement with Mongolia and the country has started to move out of the crisis. Although the banking sector remains unstable, the government is now enforcing stricter supervision regulations. In October 2009, the government passed long-awaited legislation on an investment agreement to develop Mongolia's Oyu Tolgoi mine, considered to be one of the world's largest untapped copper deposits. The economy grew 6.1% in 2010, largely on the strength of exports to nearby countries, and international reserves reached $1.6 billion in September, an all time high for Mongolia. Mongolia's economy continues to be heavily influenced by its neighbors. Mongolia purchases 95% of its petroleum products and a substantial amount of electric power from Russia, leaving it vulnerable to price increases. Trade with China represents more than half of Mongolia's total external trade - China receives more than three-fourths of Mongolia's exports. Remittances from Mongolians working abroad are sizable, but have fallen due to the economic crisis; money laundering is a growing concern. Mongolia joined the World Trade Organization in 1997 and seeks to expand its participation in regional economic and trade regimes.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":11020000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":6125000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":6.1,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":15,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":31,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":54,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":1068000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":34,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":5,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":61,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":11.5,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":36.1,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":2.9,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":24.9,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":32.8,"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":2260000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":2260000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":13,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":10.99,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":19.97,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":921400000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":1996000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":1466000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":1093000000},"Agriculture - products":"wheat, barley, vegetables, forage crops; sheep, goats, cattle, camels, horses","Industries":"construction and construction materials; mining (coal, copper, molybdenum, fluorspar, tin, tungsten, and gold); oil; food and beverages; processing of animal products, cashmere and natural fiber manufacturing","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":4500000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":3023000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":20700000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":214100000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":5975,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":16000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":5834,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":15730,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":"NA bbl (1 January 2010 est.)","Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":11790,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-378.8 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":2899000000},"Exports - commodities":"copper, apparel, livestock, animal products, cashmere, wool, hides, fluorspar, other nonferrous metals, coal","Exports - partners":"China 78.52%, Canada 9.46%, Russia 3.02% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":3300000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery and equipment, fuel, cars, food products, industrial consumer goods, chemicals, building materials, sugar, tea","Imports - partners":"China 35.99%, Russia 31.56%, South Korea 7.08%, Japan 4.8% (2009)","Debt - external":{"usd":1860000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":"$NA","Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA","Exchange rates":"togrog/tugriks (MNT) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"mh","name":"Montserrat","region":"Central America and Caribbean","background":"English and Irish colonists from St. Kitts first settled on Montserrat in 1632; the first African slaves arrived three decades later.

The economy is predominately agricultural with about 80% of the population living in rural areas. Agriculture, which has benefited from fertilizer subsidies since 2006, accounts for more than one-third of GDP and 90% of export revenues. The performance of the tobacco sector is key to short-term growth as tobacco accounts for more than half of exports. The economy depends on substantial inflows of economic assistance from the IMF, the World Bank, and individual donor nations. In 2006, Malawi was approved for relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) program. In December 2007, the US granted Malawi eligibility status to receive financial support within the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) initiative. The government faces many challenges including developing a market economy, improving educational facilities, facing up to environmental problems, dealing with the rapidly growing problem of HIV/AIDS, and satisfying foreign donors that fiscal discipline is being tightened. Since 2005 President MUTHARIKA'S government has exhibited improved financial discipline under the guidance of Finance Minister Goodall GONDWE and signed a three year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility worth $56 million with the IMF. Improved relations with the IMF lead other international donors to resume aid as well. The government has announced infrastructure projects that could yield improvements, such as a new oil pipeline, for better fuel access, and the potential for a waterway link through Mozambican rivers to the ocean, for better transportation options. Since 2009, however, Malawi has experienced some setbacks, including a general shortage of foreign exchange, which has damaged its ability to pay for imports, and fuel shortages that hinder transportation and productivity. Investment fell 23% in 2009, and continued to decline in 2010. The government has failed to address barriers to investment such as unreliable power, water shortages, poor telecommunications infrastructure, and the high costs of services.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":12980000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":5053000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":6.6,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":33.4,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":21.7,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":44.9,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":5747000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":90,"unit":"%"},"industry and services:":{"quantity":10,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":"NA%","Population below poverty line":{"quantity":53,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":31.9,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":39,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":27.7,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":1735000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":1769000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":40.4,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":8,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":15,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":25.25,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":626500000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":1434000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":1720000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":1771000000},"Agriculture - products":"tobacco, sugarcane, cotton, tea, corn, potatoes, cassava (tapioca), sorghum, pulses, groundnuts, Macadamia nuts; cattle, goats","Industries":"tobacco, tea, sugar, sawmill products, cement, consumer goods","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":17.3,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":1690000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":1572000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":8000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":6960,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-315 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":1189000000},"Exports - commodities":"tobacco 53%, tea, sugar, cotton, coffee, peanuts, wood products, apparel","Exports - partners":"Germany 12.37%, Egypt 8.52%, South Africa 7.67%, Zimbabwe 7.55%, US 7.4%, Russia 6.79%, Netherlands 6.64%, Japan 4.1% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":1675000000},"Imports - commodities":"food, petroleum products, semi-manufactures, consumer goods, transportation equipment","Imports - partners":"South Africa 40.15%, China 6.79%, India 6.73%, France 5.03%, Tanzania 4.81%, Mozambique 4.03% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":301000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":1213000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":"$NA","Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA","Exchange rates":"Malawian kwachas (MWK) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"mj","name":"Montenegro","region":"Europe","background":"The use of the name Montenegro began in the 15th century when the Crnojevic dynasty began to rule the Serbian principality of Zeta; over subsequent centuries Montenegro was able to maintain its independence from the Ottoman Empire. From the 16th to 19th centuries, Montenegro became a theocracy ruled by a series of bishop princes; in 1852, it was transformed into a secular principality. After World War I, Montenegro was absorbed by the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, which became the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929; at the conclusion of World War II, it became a constituent republic of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

At independence in September 1991, Macedonia was the least developed of the Yugoslav republics, producing a mere 5% of the total federal output of goods and services. The collapse of Yugoslavia ended transfer payments from the central government and eliminated advantages from inclusion in a de facto free trade area. An absence of infrastructure, UN sanctions on the downsized Yugoslavia, and a Greek economic embargo over a dispute about the country's constitutional name and flag hindered economic growth until 1996. Since then, Macedonia has maintained macroeconomic stability with low inflation, but it has so far lagged the region in attracting foreign investment and creating jobs, despite making extensive fiscal and business sector reforms. Official unemployment remains high at 31.7%, but may be overstated based on the existence of an extensive gray market, estimated to be more than 20% of GDP, that is not captured by official statistics. In the wake of the global economic downturn, Macedonia has experienced decreased foreign direct investment, lowered credit, and a large trade deficit. However, as a result of conservative fiscal policies and a sound financial system, in 2010 the country received slightly improved credit ratings. Macroeconomic stability also was maintained by a prudent monetary policy, which kept the domestic currency at the pegged level against the euro, while interest rates were falling. As a result, GDP growth was modest, but positive, in 2010.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":20000000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":9108000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":0.7,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":8.7,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":22.1,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":69.2,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":949300,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":19.9,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":22.1,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":58,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":31.7,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":28.7,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":2.4,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":29.6,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":39,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":23.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":2772000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":3011000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":34.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1.6,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":6.5,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":8.2,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":1146000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":4134000000.0000005},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":4001000000.0000005},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":2647000000},"Agriculture - products":"grapes, tobacco, vegetables, fruits; milk, eggs","Industries":"food processing, beverages, textiles, chemicals, iron, steel, cement, energy, pharmaceuticals","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":4,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":6819000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":8189000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":1370000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":18200,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":8594,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":18200,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":117400000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":117400000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-328 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":3171000000},"Exports - commodities":"food, beverages, tobacco; textiles, miscellaneous manufactures, iron and steel","Exports - partners":"Germany 20.31%, Greece 13.09%, Italy 11.08%, Bulgaria 10.61%, Croatia 7.74% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":5113000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery and equipment, automobiles, chemicals, fuels, food products","Imports - partners":"Germany 15.11%, Greece 14.88%, Bulgaria 9.08%, Italy 7.68%, Turkey 7.59%, Slovenia 6.26%, Hungary 4.31% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":2217000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":5485000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":3739000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA (31 December 2010)","Exchange rates":"Macedonian denars (MKD) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"ml","name":"Mali","region":"Africa","background":"The Sudanese Republic and Senegal became independent of France in 1960 as the Mali Federation.

The country's fiscal status fluctuates with gold and agricultural commodity prices and the harvest. Mali remains dependent on foreign aid. Economic activity is largely confined to the riverine area irrigated by the Niger River and about 65% of its land area is desert or semidesert. About 10% of the population is nomadic and some 80% of the labor force is engaged in farming and fishing. Industrial activity is concentrated on processing farm commodities. The government has continued an IMF-recommended structural adjustment program that has helped the economy grow, diversify, and attract foreign investment. Mali is developing its cotton and iron ore extraction industries to diversify its revenue sources because gold production has started to fall. Mali has invested in tourism but security issues are hurting the industry. Mali's adherence to economic reform and the 50% devaluation of the CFA franc in January 1994 have pushed up economic growth to a 5% average in 1996-2010.

Monaco, however, is not a tax-free shelter; it charges nearly 20% value-added tax, collects stamp duties, and companies face a 33% tax on profits unless they can show that three-quarters of profits are generated within the principality. Monaco was formally removed from the OECD's \"grey list\" of uncooperative tax jurisdictions in late 2009, but continues to face international pressure to abandon its banking secrecy laws and help combat tax evasion. The state retains monopolies in a number of sectors, including tobacco, the telephone network, and the postal service.

In the 16th century, the Sa'adi monarchy, particularly under Ahmad AL-MANSUR (1578-1603), repelled foreign invaders and inaugurated a golden age. The Alaouite dynasty, to which the current Moroccan royal family belongs, established a sultanate in Morocco beginning in the 17th century. In 1860, Spain occupied northern Morocco and ushered in a half century of trade rivalry among European powers that saw Morocco's sovereignty steadily erode; in 1912, the French imposed a protectorate over the country. A protracted independence struggle with France ended successfully in 1956. The internationalized city of Tangier and most Spanish possessions were turned over to the new country that same year. Sultan MOHAMMED V, the current monarch's grandfather, organized the new state as a constitutional monarchy and in 1957 assumed the title of king. Morocco annexed Western Sahara during the late 1970s, but final resolution on the status of the territory remains unresolved. Gradual political reforms in the 1990s resulted in the establishment of a bicameral legislature, which first met in 1997. Under King MOHAMMED VI - who in 1999 succeeded his father to the throne - human rights have improved. Morocco enjoys a moderately free press, but the government occasionally takes action against journalists who report on three broad subjects considered to be taboo: the monarchy, Islam, and the status of Western Sahara. Despite the continuing reforms, ultimate authority remains in the hands of the monarch. Influenced by protests elsewhere in the Middle East and North Africa, thousands of Moroccans in February 2011 rallied in Rabat and several other major cities to demand constitutional reform and more democracy and to protest government corruption and high food prices. A number of similar demonstrations and marches continued through March. Police response to most of the protests was subdued compared to the violence noted in protests elsewhere in the region. In early March, in response to demonstrator demands, King MOHAMMED VI announced the formation of a commission to reform the country's constitution. A draft constitution is to be presented by June 2011, followed by a popular referendum. \r\n\r\n","geo":{"Location":"Northern Africa, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, between Algeria and Western Sahara","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":32,"min":0},"W":{"deg":5,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total:":{"quantity":446550,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world:":"","land:":{"quantity":446300,"unit":"sq km"},"water:":{"quantity":250,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly larger than California","Land boundaries":{"total:":{"quantity":2017.9,"unit":"km"},"border countries:":"Algeria 1,559 km, Western Sahara 443 km, Spain (Ceuta) 6.3 km, Spain (Melilla) 9.6 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":1835,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea:":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone:":{"quantity":24,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone:":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf:":"200 m depth or to the depth of exploitation"},"Climate":"Mediterranean, becoming more extreme in the interior","Terrain":"northern coast and interior are mountainous with large areas of bordering plateaus, intermontane valleys, and rich coastal plains","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point:":"Sebkha Tah -55 m","highest point:":"Jebel Toubkal 4,165 m"},"Natural resources":"phosphates, iron ore, manganese, lead, zinc, fish, salt","Land use":{"arable land:":{"quantity":19,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops:":{"quantity":2,"unit":"%"},"other:":{"quantity":79,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":14570,"unit":"sq km"},"Total renewable water resources":{"quantity":29,"unit":"cu km"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total:":{"quantity":12.6,"unit":"cu km/yr"},"per capita:":{"quantity":400,"unit":"cu m/yr"}},"Natural hazards":"northern mountains geologically unstable and subject to earthquakes;

Economic policies pursued since 2003 by King MOHAMMED VI have brought macroeconomic stability to the country with generally low inflation, improved financial performance, and steady progress in developing the service and industrial sectors. In 2006, Morocco entered a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the US, and in 2008 entered into an advanced status in its 2000 Association Agreement with the EU. However, poverty, illiteracy, and unemployment rates remain high. In response to these challenges, King MOHAMMED in 2005 launched a National Initiative for Human Development, a $2 billion program aimed at alleviating poverty and underdevelopment by expanding electricity to rural areas and replacing urban slums with public and subsidized housing, among other policies. Morocco's trade and budget deficits widened in 2010, and reducing government spending and adapting to sluggish economic growth in Europe will be challenges in 2011. Morocco's long-term challenges include improving education and job prospects for young Moroccans, closing the disparity in wealth between the rich and the poor, confronting corruption, and expanding and diversifying exports beyond phosphates and low-value-added products.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":151400000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":103500000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":3.2,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":17.1,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":31.6,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":51.4,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":11630000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":44.6,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":19.8,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":35.5,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":9.8,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":15,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":2.7,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":33.2,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":40.9,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":30.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":23420000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":27080000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":58.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":2.5,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":3.31,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":6.5,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":67330000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":108700000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":93210000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":62910000000},"Agriculture - products":"barley, wheat, citrus fruits, grapes, vegetables, olives; livestock; wine","Industries":"phosphate rock mining and processing, food processing, leather goods, textiles, construction, energy, tourism","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":4.4,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":19780000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":20780000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":3429000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":4053,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":187000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":17420,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":195800,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":100000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":60000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":560000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":500000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":1501000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-7.922 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":14490000000},"Exports - commodities":"clothing and textiles, electric components, inorganic chemicals, transistors, crude minerals, fertilizers (including phosphates), petroleum products, citrus fruits, vegetables, fish","Exports - partners":"Spain 22.02%, France 20.22%, India 4.91%, Italy 4% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":34189999999.999996},"Imports - commodities":"crude petroleum, textile fabric, telecommunications equipment, wheat, gas and electricity, transistors, plastics","Imports - partners":"France 16.95%, Spain 14.72%, China 7.1%, Italy 6.76%, Germany 6.28%, US 5.66%, Saudi Arabia 5.11% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":24570000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":22690000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":42190000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":1046999999.9999999},"Exchange rates":"Moroccan dirhams (MAD) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"mp","name":"Mauritius","region":"Africa","background":"Although known to Arab and Malay sailors as early as the 10th century, Mauritius was first explored by the Portuguese in the 16th century and subsequently settled by the Dutch - who named it in honor of Prince Maurits van NASSAU - in the 17th century.

For most of the period, annual growth has been in the order of 5% to 6%. This remarkable achievement has been reflected in more equitable income distribution, increased life expectancy, lowered infant mortality, and a much-improved infrastructure. The economy rests on sugar, tourism, textiles and apparel, and financial services, and is expanding into fish processing, information and communications technology, and hospitality and property development. Sugarcane is grown on about 90% of the cultivated land area and accounts for 15% of export earnings. The government's development strategy centers on creating vertical and horizontal clusters of development in these sectors. Mauritius has attracted more than 32,000 offshore entities, many aimed at commerce in India, South Africa, and China. Investment in the banking sector alone has reached over $1 billion. Mauritius, with its strong textile sector, has been well poised to take advantage of the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). Mauritius' sound economic policies and prudent banking practices helped to mitigate negative effects from the global financial crisis in 2008-09. GDP grew 3.6% in 2010 and the country continues to expand its trade and investment outreach around the globe.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":18060000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":9729000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":4,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":4.8,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":24.6,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":70.5,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":597000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture and fishing:":{"quantity":9,"unit":"%"},"construction and industry:":{"quantity":30,"unit":"%"},"transportation and communication:":{"quantity":7,"unit":"%"},"trade, restaurants, hotels:":{"quantity":22,"unit":"%"},"finance:":{"quantity":6,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":7.5,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":8,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":"NA%","highest 10%:":"NA%"},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":39,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":23.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":2113999999.9999998},"expenditures:":{"usd":2583000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":60.5,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":2.9,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":"NA%","Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":19.25,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":1889000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":9605000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":10230000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":4740000000},"Agriculture - products":"sugarcane, tea, corn, potatoes, bananas, pulses; cattle, goats; fish","Industries":"food processing (largely sugar milling), textiles, clothing, mining, chemicals, metal products, transport equipment, nonelectrical machinery, tourism","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":3.3,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":2321000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":2158000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":23000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":22200,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-949 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":2041000000},"Exports - commodities":"clothing and textiles, sugar, cut flowers, molasses, fish","Exports - partners":"UK 25.55%, France 16.89%, US 9.51%, Italy 5.68%, UAE 5.47%, Belgium 4.93%, Madagascar 4.11% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":3935000000},"Imports - commodities":"manufactured goods, capital equipment, foodstuffs, petroleum products, chemicals","Imports - partners":"India 24.5%, France 14.02%, South Africa 8.55%, China 8.17% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":2360000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":5043000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":"$NA","Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA","Exchange rates":"Mauritian rupees (MUR) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"mr","name":"Mauritania","region":"Africa","background":"Independent from France in 1960, Mauritania annexed the southern third of the former Spanish Sahara (now Western Sahara) in 1976 but relinquished it after three years of raids by the Polisario guerrilla front seeking independence for the territory.

The nation's coastal waters are among the richest fishing areas in the world but overexploitation by foreigners threatens this key source of revenue. The country's first deepwater port opened near Nouakchott in 1986. Before 2000, drought and economic mismanagement resulted in a buildup of foreign debt. In February 2000, Mauritania qualified for debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative and nearly all of its foreign debt has since been forgiven. A new investment code approved in December 2001 improved the opportunities for direct foreign investment. Mauritania and the IMF agreed to a three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement in 2006. Mauritania made satisfactory progress, but the IMF, World Bank, and other international actors suspended assistance and investment in Mauritania after the August 2008 coup. Since the presidential election in July 2009, donors have resumed assistance. Oil prospects, while initially promising, have largely failed to materialize, and the government has placed a priority on attracting private investment to spur economic growth.

Malta's financial services industry has grown in recent years and in 2008-09 it escaped significant damage from the international financial crisis, largely because the sector is centered on the indigenous real estate market and is not highly leveraged. Locally, the restricted damage from the financial crisis has been attributed to the stability of the Maltese banking system and to its prudent risk-management practices. The global economic downturn and high electricity and water prices hurt Malta's real economy, which is dependent on foreign trade, manufacturing - especially electronics and pharmaceuticals - and tourism, but growth bounced back as the global economy recovered in 2010.

In early 2011, the EU ended excessive deficit procedures against Malta, after Malta had taken measures to correct an excessive deficit in 2010 and appeared likely to reach its deficit target of 2.8% of GDP in 2011.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":10410000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":8288000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":3.7,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":1.9,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":17.2,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":80.9,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":163100,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":1.3,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":24.8,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":73.9,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":6.9,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":"NA%","highest 10%:":"NA%"},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":26,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":8.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":4455000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":3322000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":69.1,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":3.3,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":1.75,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":4.47,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":7046000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":13210000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":18660000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":1982000000},"Agriculture - products":"potatoes, cauliflower, grapes, wheat, barley, tomatoes, citrus, cut flowers, green peppers; pork, milk, poultry, eggs","Industries":"tourism, electronics, ship building and repair, construction, food and beverages, pharmaceuticals, footwear, clothing, tobacco, aviation services, financial services, information technology services","Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Electricity - production":{"quantity":2113000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":1991000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":19000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":17910,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-362.8 million (2010)","Exports":{"usd":3124000000},"Exports - commodities":"electrical machinery, mechanical appliances, fish and crustaceans, pharmaceutical products, printed material","Exports - partners":"Germany 13.3%, Singapore 12.5%, France 11.4%, US 9.4%, Hong Kong 6.5%, UK 5.9%, Italy 4.8% (2009 est.)","Imports":{"usd":5159000000},"Imports - commodities":"mineral fuels and oils, electrical machinery, non-electrical machinery, aircraft and other transport equipment, plastic and other semi-manufactured goods; food, drink, tobacco","Imports - partners":"Italy 24.4%, UK 11.7%, Germany 9.3%, France 7.6%, China 4.2% (2009 est.)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":522000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":5978000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":16629999999.999998},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":1213000000},"Exchange rates":"euros (EUR) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"mu","name":"Oman","region":"Middle East","background":"The inhabitants of the area of Oman have long prospered on Indian Ocean trade.

Over 90% of government tax revenue comes from import duties and tourism-related taxes. Fishing is the second leading sector, but the fish catch has dropped sharply in recent years. Agriculture and manufacturing continue to play a lesser role in the economy, constrained by the limited availability of cultivable land and the shortage of domestic labor. Most staple foods must be imported. In the last decade, real GDP growth averaged around 6% per year except for 2005, when GDP declined following the Indian Ocean tsunami, and in 2009, when GDP shrank by 3% as tourist arrivals declined and capital flows plunged in the wake of the global financial crisis. Falling tourist arrivals and fish exports, combined with high government spending on social needs, subsidies, and civil servant salaries contributed to a balance of payments crisis, which was eased with a December 2009, $79.3 million dollar IMF standby agreement. However, after the first two disbursements, the IMF withheld subsequent disbursements due to concerns over Maldives' growing budget deficit. Maldives has had chronic budget deficits in recent years and the government's plans to cut expenditures have not progressed well. A new Goods and Services Tax on Tourism (GST) was introduced in January 2011 and a new Business Profit Tax is to be introduced during the year. These taxes are expected to increase government revenue by about 25%. The government has privatized the main airport and is partially privatizing the energy sector. Tourism will remain the engine of the economy. The Government of the Maldives has aggressively promoted building new island resorts. Due to increasing tourist arrivals, the government expects GDP growth around 4.0% in 2011. Diversifying the economy beyond tourism and fishing, reforming public finance, and increasing employment opportunities are major challenges facing the government. Over the longer term Maldivian authorities worry about the impact of erosion and possible global warming on their low-lying country; 80% of the area is 1 meter or less above sea level.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":2734000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":1870000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":8,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":5.6,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":16.9,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":77.5,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":110000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":11,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":23,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":65,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":14.5,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":16,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":"NA%","highest 10%:":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":476000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":758000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":6,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":13,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":13,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":588000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":1239000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":1548000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Agriculture - products":"coconuts, corn, sweet potatoes; fish","Industries":"tourism, fish processing, shipping, boat building, coconut processing, garments, woven mats, rope, handicrafts, coral and sand mining","Industrial production growth rate":"-0.9% (2004 est.)","Electricity - production":{"quantity":542000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":542000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":6000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":5490,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-463 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":163000000},"Exports - commodities":"fish","Exports - partners":"France 17.01%, Thailand 15.16%, Italy 13.49%, UK 13.13%, Sri Lanka 12.38% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":967000000},"Imports - commodities":"petroleum products, ships, foodstuffs, clothing, intermediate and capital goods","Imports - partners":"Singapore 24.62%, UAE 15.7%, India 11.02%, Malaysia 8.98%, Sri Lanka 5.4%, Thailand 5.36% (2009)","Debt - external":{"usd":943000000},"Exchange rates":"rufiyaa (MVR) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"mx","name":"Mexico","region":"North America","background":"The site of advanced Amerindian civilizations, Mexico came under Spanish rule for three centuries before achieving independence early in the 19th century.

It contains a mixture of modern and outmoded industry and agriculture, increasingly dominated by the private sector. Recent administrations have expanded competition in seaports, railroads, telecommunications, electricity generation, natural gas distribution, and airports. Per capita income is roughly one-third that of the US; income distribution remains highly unequal. Since the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994, Mexico's share of US imports has increased from 7% to 12%, and its share of Canadian imports has doubled to 5%. Mexico has free trade agreements with over 50 countries including, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, the European Free Trade Area, and Japan, putting more than 90% of trade under free trade agreements. In 2007, during its first year in office, the Felipe CALDERON administration was able to garner support from the opposition to successfully pass pension and fiscal reforms. The administration passed an energy reform measure in 2008 and another fiscal reform in 2009. Mexico's GDP plunged 6.5% in 2009 as world demand for exports dropped, asset prices tumbled, and remittances and investment declined. GDP posted positive growth of 5% in 2010, with exports - particularly to the United States - leading the way, while domestic consumption and investment lagged. The administration continues to face many economic challenges, including improving the public education system, upgrading infrastructure, modernizing labor laws, and fostering private investment in the energy sector. CALDERON has stated that his top economic priorities remain reducing poverty and creating jobs.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":1567000000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":1038999999999.9999},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":5.5,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":4.2,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":33.3,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":62.5,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":46990000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":13.7,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":23.4,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":62.9,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":5.6,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Population below poverty line":{"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":18.2,"unit":"%"}},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":1.7,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":36.3,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":48.2,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":21.1,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":237000000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":267000000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":41.5,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":4.1,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":"NA%","Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":7.07,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":135699999999.99998},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":583800000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":342400000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":340600000000},"Agriculture - products":"corn, wheat, soybeans, rice, beans, cotton, coffee, fruit, tomatoes; beef, poultry, dairy products; wood products","Industries":"food and beverages, tobacco, chemicals, iron and steel, petroleum, mining, textiles, clothing, motor vehicles, consumer durables, tourism","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":6,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":245000000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":181500000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":1288000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":584000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":3001000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":2077999.9999999998,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":1225000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":521100,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":12420000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":60350000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":59800000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":688000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":11840000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":359700000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-7 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":303000000000},"Exports - commodities":"manufactured goods, oil and oil products, silver, fruits, vegetables, coffee, cotton","Exports - partners":"US 80.5%, Canada 3.6%, Germany 1.4% (2009 est.)","Imports":{"usd":306000000000},"Imports - commodities":"metalworking machines, steel mill products, agricultural machinery, electrical equipment, car parts for assembly, repair parts for motor vehicles, aircraft, and aircraft parts","Imports - partners":"US 48%, China 13.5%, Japan 4.8%, South Korea 4.6%, Germany 4.1% (2009 est.)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":116400000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":212500000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":328400000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":62930000000},"Exchange rates":"Mexican pesos (MXN) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"my","name":"Malaysia","region":"East & Southeast Asia","background":"During the late 18th and 19th centuries, Great Britain established colonies and protectorates in the area of current Malaysia; these were occupied by Japan from 1942 to 1945.

Under current Prime Minister NAJIB, Malaysia is attempting to achieve high-income status by 2020 and to move farther up the value-added production chain by attracting investments in Islamic finance, high technology industries, biotechnology, and services. The NAJIB administration also is continuing efforts to boost domestic demand and reduce the economy's dependence on exports. Nevertheless, exports - particularly of electronics, oil and gas, palm oil and rubber - remain a significant driver of the economy. As an oil and gas exporter, Malaysia has profited from higher world energy prices, although the rising cost of domestic gasoline and diesel fuel, combined with strained government finances, has forced Kuala Lumpur begin to reduce government subsidies. The government is also trying to lessen its dependence on state oil producer Petronas, which supplies more than 40% of government revenue. The central bank maintains healthy foreign exchange reserves and its well-developed regulatory regime has limited Malaysia's exposure to riskier financial instruments and the global financial crisis. Nevertheless, decreasing worldwide demand for consumer goods hurt Malaysia's exports and economic growth in 2009, although both showed signs of recovery in 2010. In order to attract increased investment, NAJIB has raised possible revisions to the special economic and social preferences accorded to ethnic Malays under the New Economic Policy of 1970, but he has encountered significant opposition, especially from Malay nationalists and other vested interests.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":414400000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":238000000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":7.2,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":9.1,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":41.6,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":49.3,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":12200000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":13,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":36,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":51,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":3.5,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":3.6,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":2.6,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":28.5,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":44.1,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":20.1,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":46780000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":46340000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":53.1,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1.7,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":2.83,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":6.27,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":73800000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":358100000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":314700000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":256000000000},"Agriculture - products":"Peninsular Malaysia - rubber, palm oil, cocoa, rice; Sabah - subsistence crops, coconuts, rice; rubber, timber; Sarawak - rubber, timber; pepper","Industries":"Peninsular Malaysia - rubber and oil palm processing and manufacturing, light manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, medical technology, electronics, tin mining and smelting, logging, timber processing; Sabah - logging, petroleum production; Sarawak - agriculture processing, petroleum production and refining, logging","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":7.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":107400000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":93800000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":91700000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":693700,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":536000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":511900,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":314600,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":2900000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":57300000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":26270000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":31030000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":2350000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":34140000000},"Exports":{"usd":210300000000},"Exports - commodities":"electronic equipment, petroleum and liquefied natural gas, wood and wood products, palm oil, rubber, textiles, chemicals","Exports - partners":"Singapore 13.4%, China 12.6%, Japan 10.4%, US 9.5%, Thailand 5.3%, Hong Kong 5.1% (2010 est.)","Imports":{"usd":174300000000},"Imports - commodities":"electronics, machinery, petroleum products, plastics, vehicles, iron and steel products, chemicals","Imports - partners":"China 12.6%, Japan 12.6%, Singapore 11.4%, US 10.7%, Thailand 6.2%, Indonesia 5.6% (2010 est.)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":106500000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":72600000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":77440000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":82650000000},"Exchange rates":"ringgits (MYR) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"mz","name":"Mozambique","region":"Africa","background":"Almost five centuries as a Portuguese colony came to a close with independence in 1975.

A UN-negotiated peace agreement between Frelimo and rebel Mozambique National Resistance (Renamo) forces ended the fighting in 1992.

His elected successor, Armando Emilio GUEBUZA, promised to continue the sound economic policies that have encouraged foreign investment. President GUEBUZA was reelected to a second term in October 2009. However, the elections were flawed by voter fraud, questionable disqualification of candidates, and Frelimo use of government resources during the campaign.

Socialist mismanagement and a brutal civil war from 1977-92 exacerbated the situation. In 1987, the government embarked on a series of macroeconomic reforms designed to stabilize the economy. These steps, combined with donor assistance and with political stability since the multi-party elections in 1994, have led to dramatic improvements in the country's growth rate. Fiscal reforms, including the introduction of a value-added tax and reform of the customs service, have improved the government's revenue collection abilities. In spite of these gains, Mozambique remains dependent upon foreign assistance for more than half of its annual budget, and the majority of the population remains below the poverty line. Subsistence agriculture continues to employ the vast majority of the country's work force and smallholder agricultural productivity and productivity growth is weak. A substantial trade imbalance persists although the opening of the Mozal aluminum smelter, the country's largest foreign investment project to date, has increased export earnings. At the end of 2007, and after years of negotiations, the government took over Portugal's majority share of the Cahora Bassa Hydroelectricity (HCB) company, a dam that was not transferred to Mozambique at independence because of the ensuing civil war and unpaid debts. More electrical power capacity is needed for additional investment projects in titanium extraction and processing and garment manufacturing that could further close the import/export gap. Mozambique's once substantial foreign debt has been reduced through forgiveness and rescheduling under the IMF's Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and Enhanced HIPC initiatives, and is now at a manageable level. In July 2007 the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) signed a compact with Mozambique; the compact entered into force in September 2008 and will continue for five years. Compact projects will focus on improving sanitation, roads, agriculture, and the business regulation environment in an effort to spur economic growth in the four northern provinces of the country. Mozambique grew at an average annual rate of 9% in the decade up to 2007, one of Africa's strongest performances. However, heavy reliance on aluminum, which accounts for about one-third of exports, subjects the economy to volatile international prices. The sharp decline in aluminum prices during the global economic crisis lowered GDP growth by several percentage points. Despite 8.3% GDP growth in 2010, the increasing cost of living prompted citizens to riot in September 2010, after fuel, water, electricity, and bread price increases were announced. In an attempt to contain the cost of living, the government implemented subsidies, decreased taxes and tariffs, and instituted other fiscal measures.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":21810000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":9893000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":7,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":28.8,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":26,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":45.2,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":9870000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":81,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":6,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":13,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":21,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":70,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":2.1,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":39.2,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":47.3,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":17.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":2346000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":2898000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":40.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":13.5,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":9.95,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":15.68,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":2657000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":3803000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":2740000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Agriculture - products":"cotton, cashew nuts, sugarcane, tea, cassava (tapioca), corn, coconuts, sisal, citrus and tropical fruits, potatoes, sunflowers; beef, poultry","Industries":"food, beverages, chemicals (fertilizer, soap, paints), aluminum, petroleum products, textiles, cement, glass, asbestos, tobacco","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":8,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":15910000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":10160000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":11820000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":8278000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":18000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":13760,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":3300000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":100000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":3200000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":127400000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-1.028 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":2517000000},"Exports - commodities":"aluminum, prawns, cashews, cotton, sugar, citrus, timber; bulk electricity","Exports - partners":"Netherlands 47.62%, South Africa 11.6% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":3527000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery and equipment, vehicles, fuel, chemicals, metal products, foodstuffs, textiles","Imports - partners":"South Africa 33.54%, Netherlands 8.42%, India 5.93%, China 4.24% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":1982000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":4990000000},"Exchange rates":"meticais (MZM) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"nc","name":"New Caledonia","region":"Australia-Oceania","background":"Settled by both Britain and France during the first half of the 19th century, the island was made a French possession in 1853.

Industry consists primarily of small factories to process passion fruit, lime oil, honey, and coconut cream. The sale of postage stamps to foreign collectors is an important source of revenue. The island in recent years has suffered a serious loss of population because of emigration to New Zealand. Efforts to increase GDP include the promotion of tourism and financial services, although the International Banking Repeal Act of 2002 resulted in the termination of all offshore banking licenses.

In 1999, BARE was killed in a counter coup by military officers who restored democratic rule and held elections that brought Mamadou TANDJA to power in December of that year. TANDJA was reelected in 2004 and in 2009 spearheaded a constitutional amendment that would allow him to extend his term as president. In February 2010, a military coup deposed TANDJA, immediately suspended the constitution and dissolved the Cabinet, and promised that elections would be held following a transitional period of unspecified duration.

Niger shares a common currency, the CFA franc, and a common central bank, the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO), with seven other members of the West African Monetary Union. In December 2000, Niger qualified for enhanced debt relief under the International Monetary Fund program for Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and concluded an agreement with the Fund on a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). Debt relief provided under the enhanced HIPC initiative significantly reduces Niger's annual debt service obligations, freeing funds for expenditures on basic health care, primary education, HIV/AIDS prevention, rural infrastructure, and other programs geared at poverty reduction. In December 2005, Niger received 100% multilateral debt relief from the IMF, which translates into the forgiveness of approximately US $86 million in debts to the IMF, excluding the remaining assistance under HIPC. In 2010, the Niger economy was recovering from the effects of a 2009 drought that reduced grain and cowpea production and decimated livestock herds. The economy was also hurt when the international community cut off non-humanitarian aid in response to TANDJA's moves to extend his term as president. Nearly half of the government's budget is derived from foreign donor resources. Future growth may be sustained by exploitation of oil, gold, coal, and other mineral resources.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":11050000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":5577000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":7.5,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":39,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":17,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":44,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":4688000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":90,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":6,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":4,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":"NA%","Population below poverty line":{"quantity":63,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":2.3,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":35.7,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":50.5,"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":320000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":320000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":0.1,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":4.25,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":"NA%","Stock of narrow money":{"usd":782600000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":1038000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":683600000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Agriculture - products":"cowpeas, cotton, peanuts, millet, sorghum, cassava (tapioca), rice; cattle, sheep, goats, camels, donkeys, horses, poultry","Industries":"uranium mining, cement, brick, soap, textiles, food processing, chemicals, slaughterhouses","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":5.1,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":150000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":589500000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":450000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":6000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":5367,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-321 million (2007 est.)","Exports":{"usd":428000000},"Exports - commodities":"uranium ore, livestock, cowpeas, onions","Exports - partners":"France 52.63%, Nigeria 22.43%, US 18.24% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":800000000},"Imports - commodities":"foodstuffs, machinery, vehicles and parts, petroleum, cereals","Imports - partners":"China 16.32%, France 15.95%, Netherlands 7.66%, Algeria 7.15%, French Polynesia 6.11%, Nigeria 5.48%, Cote d'Ivoire 4.15%, US 4.05% (2009)","Debt - external":{"usd":2100000000},"Exchange rates":"Communaute Financiere Africaine francs (XOF) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"nh","name":"Vanuatu","region":"Australia-Oceania","background":"Multiple waves of colonizers, each speaking a distinct language, migrated to the New Hebrides in the millennia preceding European exploration in the 18th century.

Nigeria's former military rulers failed to diversify the economy away from its overdependence on the capital-intensive oil sector, which provides 95% of foreign exchange earnings and about 80% of budgetary revenues. Following the signing of an IMF stand-by agreement in August 2000, Nigeria received a debt-restructuring deal from the Paris Club and a $1 billion credit from the IMF, both contingent on economic reforms. Nigeria pulled out of its IMF program in April 2002, after failing to meet spending and exchange rate targets, making it ineligible for additional debt forgiveness from the Paris Club. In November 2005, Abuja won Paris Club approval for a debt-relief deal that eliminated $18 billion of debt in exchange for $12 billion in payments - a total package worth $30 billion of Nigeria's total $37 billion external debt. Since 2008 the government has begun to show the political will to implement the market-oriented reforms urged by the IMF, such as modernizing the banking system, curbing inflation by blocking excessive wage demands, and resolving regional disputes over the distribution of earnings from the oil industry. GDP rose strongly in 2007-10 because of increased oil exports and high global crude prices in 2010. President JONATHAN has pledged to continue the economic reforms of his predecessor with emphasis on infrastructure improvements. Infrastructure is the main impediment to growth and in August 2010 JONATHAN unveiled a power sector blueprint that includes privatization of the state-run electricity generation and distribution facilities. The government also is working toward developing stronger public-private partnerships for roads. Nigeria's financial sector was hurt by the global financial and economic crises and the Central Bank governor has taken measures to strengthen that sector.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":377900000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":216800000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":8.4,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":31.9,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":32.9,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":35.2,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":48330000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":70,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":10,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":20,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":4.9,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":70,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":2,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":32.4,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":43.7,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":11.6,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":18160000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":29550000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":13.4,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":13.9,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":6,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":18.36,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":40410000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":91970000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":77430000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":33320000000},"Agriculture - products":"cocoa, peanuts, cotton, palm oil, corn, rice, sorghum, millet, cassava (tapioca), yams, rubber; cattle, sheep, goats, pigs; timber; fish","Industries":"crude oil, coal, tin, columbite; rubber products, wood; hides and skins, textiles, cement and other construction materials, food products, footwear, chemicals, fertilizer, printing, ceramics, steel","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":4,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":21920000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":19210000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":2211000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":280000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":2327000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":170000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":37500000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":32820000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":12280000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":20550000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":5246000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":27770000000},"Exports":{"usd":76330000000},"Exports - commodities":"petroleum and petroleum products 95%, cocoa, rubber","Exports - partners":"US 35.08%, India 10.43%, Brazil 9.32%, Spain 7.19%, France 4.65% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":34180000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery, chemicals, transport equipment, manufactured goods, food and live animals","Imports - partners":"China 14.89%, US 8.88%, Netherlands 8.18%, South Korea 5.46%, UK 4.63%, France 4.19% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":43360000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":11020000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":67230000000.00001},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":6071000000},"Exchange rates":"nairas (NGN) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"nl","name":"Netherlands","region":"Europe","background":"The Dutch United Provinces declared their independence from Spain in 1579; during the 17th century, they became a leading seafaring and commercial power, with settlements and colonies around the world.

Industrial activity is predominantly in food processing, chemicals, petroleum refining, and electrical machinery. A highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2% of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports. The Netherlands, along with 11 of its EU partners, began circulating the euro currency on 1 January 2002. The country has been one of the leading European nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the four largest investors in the US. After 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth, the Netherlands' economy - which is highly open and dependent on foreign trade and financial services - was hard-hit by global economic crisis. Dutch GDP contracted 3.9% in 2009, while exports declined nearly 25% due to a sharp contraction in world demand. The Dutch financial sector has also suffered, due in part to the high exposure of some Dutch banks to U.S. mortgage-backed securities. In response to turmoil in financial markets, the government nationalized two banks and injected billions of dollars into a third, to prevent further systemic risk. The government also sought to boost the domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs, offering corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers, and expanding export credit facilities. The stimulus programs and bank bailouts, however, resulted in a government budget deficit of nearly 4.6% of GDP in 2009 and 5.6% in 2010 that contrasts sharply with a surplus of 0.7% of GDP in 2008. With unemployment weighing on private-sector consumption, the government of Prime Minister Mark RUTTE is likely to come under increased pressure to keep the budget deficit in check while promoting economic recovery.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":676900000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":783300000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":1.7,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":2.6,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":24.9,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":72.4,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":7860000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":2,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":18,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":80,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":5.5,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":10.5,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":2.5,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":22.9,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":30.9,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":18,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":356000000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":399300000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":64.6,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1.1,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":1.75,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":10.01,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":368100000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":1124000000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":2083000000000.0002},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":542500000000},"Agriculture - products":"grains, potatoes, sugar beets, fruits, vegetables; livestock","Industries":"agroindustries, metal and engineering products, electrical machinery and equipment, chemicals, petroleum, construction, microelectronics, fishing","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":3.2,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":108200000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":124100000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":10560000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":15450000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":57190,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":922800,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":1660000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":2426000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":100000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":79580000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":48600000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":55590000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":24600000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":1416000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":46690000000},"Exports":{"usd":451300000000},"Exports - commodities":"machinery and equipment, chemicals, fuels; foodstuffs","Exports - partners":"Germany 25.54%, Belgium 12.49%, France 9.27%, UK 8.17%, Italy 5.07%, US 3.97% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":408400000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery and transport equipment, chemicals, fuels, foodstuffs, clothing","Imports - partners":"Germany 17.16%, China 11.58%, Belgium 8.68%, US 7.77%, UK 5.72%, Russia 4.47%, France 4.4% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":"$NA (31 December 2010 est.)","Debt - external":"$NA (30 June 2010)","Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":687800000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":950800000000},"Exchange rates":"euros (EUR) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"no","name":"Norway","region":"Europe","background":"Two centuries of Viking raids into Europe tapered off following the adoption of Christianity by King Olav TRYGGVASON in 994.

In 1814, Norwegians resisted the cession of their country to Sweden and adopted a new constitution. Sweden then invaded Norway but agreed to let Norway keep its constitution in return for accepting the union under a Swedish king. Rising nationalism throughout the 19th century led to a 1905 referendum granting Norway independence. Although Norway remained neutral in World War I, it suffered heavy losses to its shipping. Norway proclaimed its neutrality at the outset of World War II, but was nonetheless occupied for five years by Nazi Germany (1940-45). In 1949, neutrality was abandoned and Norway became a member of NATO. Discovery of oil and gas in adjacent waters in the late 1960s boosted Norway's economic fortunes. In referenda held in 1972 and 1994, Norway rejected joining the EU. Key domestic issues include immigration and integration of ethnic minorities, maintaining the country's extensive social safety net with an aging population, and preserving economic competitiveness.","geo":{"Location":"Northern Europe, bordering the North Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean, west of Sweden","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":62,"min":0},"E":{"deg":10,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total:":{"quantity":323802,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world:":"","land:":{"quantity":304282,"unit":"sq km"},"water:":{"quantity":19520,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly larger than New Mexico","Land boundaries":{"total:":{"quantity":2542,"unit":"km"},"border countries:":"Finland 727 km, Sweden 1,619 km, Russia 196 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":25148,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea:":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone:":{"quantity":10,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone:":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf:":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"}},"Climate":"temperate along coast, modified by North Atlantic Current;

Norway is the world's second-largest gas exporter; its position as an oil exporter has slipped to ninth-largest as production has begun to decline. Norway opted to stay out of the EU during a referendum in November 1994; nonetheless, as a member of the European Economic Area, it contributes sizably to the EU budget. In anticipation of eventual declines in oil and gas production, Norway saves state revenue from the petroleum sector in the world's second largest sovereign wealth fund, valued at over $500 billion in 2010.

Reforms in 1990 established a multiparty democracy within the framework of a constitutional monarchy. An insurgency led by Maoist extremists broke out in 1996. The ensuing ten-year civil war between insurgents and government forces witnessed the dissolution of the cabinet and parliament and assumption of absolute power by the king. Several weeks of mass protests in April 2006 were followed by several months of peace negotiations between the Maoists and government officials, and culminated in a November 2006 peace accord and the promulgation of an interim constitution. Following a nation-wide election in April 2008, the newly formed Constituent Assembly declared Nepal a federal democratic republic and abolished the monarchy at its first meeting the following month. The Constituent Assembly elected the country's first president in July. The Maoists, who received a plurality of votes in the Constituent Assembly election, formed a coalition government in August 2008, but resigned in May 2009 after the president overruled a decision to fire the chief of the army staff. The Communist Party of Nepal-United Marxist-Leninist and the Nepali Congress party then formed a new coalition government with several smaller parties. The prime minister's resignation in June 2010 ushered in seven months of political gridlock until Jhala Nath KHANAL was elected as replacement in February 2011. His pressing tasks are to conclude the drafting of a new constitution by the late May 2011 deadline and to determine the future of the former Maoist combatants.","geo":{"Location":"Southern Asia, between China and India","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":28,"min":0},"E":{"deg":84,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total:":{"quantity":147181,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world:":"","land:":{"quantity":143351,"unit":"sq km"},"water:":{"quantity":3830,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly larger than Arkansas","Land boundaries":{"total:":{"quantity":2926,"unit":"km"},"border countries:":"China 1,236 km, India 1,690 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":"none (landlocked)","Climate":"varies from cool summers and severe winters in north to subtropical summers and mild winters in south","Terrain":"Tarai or flat river plain of the Ganges in south, central hill region, rugged Himalayas in north","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point:":"Kanchan Kalan 70 m","highest point:":"Mount Everest 8,850 m"},"Natural resources":"quartz, water, timber, hydropower, scenic beauty, small deposits of lignite, copper, cobalt, iron ore","Land use":{"arable land:":{"quantity":16.07,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops:":{"quantity":0.85,"unit":"%"},"other:":{"quantity":83.08,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":11680,"unit":"sq km"},"Total renewable water resources":{"quantity":210.2,"unit":"cu km"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total:":{"quantity":10.18,"unit":"cu km/yr"},"per capita:":{"quantity":375,"unit":"cu m/yr"}},"Natural hazards":"severe thunderstorms;

Few other resources exist, with most necessities being imported, mainly from Australia, its former occupier and later major source of support. In 2005 an Australian company entered into an agreement to exploit remaining supplies. Primary reserves of phosphates were exhausted and mining ceased in 2006, but mining of a deeper layer of \"secondary phosphate\" in the interior of the island began the following year. The secondary phosphate deposits may last another 30 years. The rehabilitation of mined land and the replacement of income from phosphates are serious long-term problems. In anticipation of the exhaustion of Nauru's phosphate deposits, substantial amounts of phosphate income were invested in trust funds to help cushion the transition and provide for Nauru's economic future. As a result of heavy spending from the trust funds, the government faced virtual bankruptcy. To cut costs the government has frozen wages and reduced overstaffed public service departments.

In 2000, the government of Ronald VENETIAAN, returned to office and inherited an economy with inflation of over 100% and a growing fiscal deficit. He quickly implemented an austerity program, raised taxes, attempted to control spending, and tamed inflation. Economic growth reached about 7% in 2008, owing to sizeable foreign investment in mining and oil. Suriname has received aid for projects in the bauxite and gold mining sectors from Netherlands, Belgium, and the European Development Fund. The economy slowed in 2009, however, as investment waned and the country earned less from its commodity exports when global prices for most commodities fell. Trade picked up, boosting Suriname's economic growth in 2010, but the government's budget remained strained, with increased social spending during the election. In January 2011, the government devalued the currency by 20% and raised taxes to reduce the budget deficit. Suriname's economic prospects for the medium term will depend on continued commitment to responsible monetary and fiscal policies and to the introduction of structural reforms to liberalize markets and promote competition.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":4711000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":3682000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":4.4,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":10.8,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":24.4,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":64.8,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":165600,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":8,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":14,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":78,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":9.5,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":70,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":"NA%","highest 10%:":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":392600000},"expenditures:":{"usd":425900000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":6.4,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":11.65,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":608000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":1809000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":793100000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Agriculture - products":"paddy rice, bananas, palm kernels, coconuts, plantains, peanuts; beef, chickens; shrimp; forest products","Industries":"bauxite and gold mining, alumina production; oil, lumbering, food processing, fishing","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":6.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":1605000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":1467000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":15190,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":14000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":4308,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":6296,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":79600000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":24000000},"Exports":{"usd":1391000000},"Exports - commodities":"alumina, gold, crude oil, lumber, shrimp and fish, rice, bananas","Exports - partners":"Canada 35.47%, Belgium 14.92%, US 10.15%, UAE 9.87%, Norway 4.92%, Netherlands 4.7%, France 4.47% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":1297000000},"Imports - commodities":"capital equipment, petroleum, foodstuffs, cotton, consumer goods","Imports - partners":"US 30.79%, Netherlands 19.17%, Trinidad and Tobago 13.04%, China 6.8%, Japan 5.85% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":263300000},"Debt - external":{"usd":504300000},"Exchange rates":"Surinamese dollars (SRD) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"nu","name":"Nicaragua","region":"Central America and Caribbean","background":"The Pacific coast of Nicaragua was settled as a Spanish colony from Panama in the early 16th century.

Textiles and apparel account for nearly 60% of Nicaragua's exports, but increases in the minimum wage during the ORTEGA administration will likely erode its comparative advantage in this industry. ORTEGA's promotion of mixed business initiatives, owned by the Nicaraguan and Venezuelan state oil firms, together with the weak rule of law, could undermine the investment climate for domestic and international private firms in the near-term. Nicaragua relies on international economic assistance to meet internal- and external-debt financing obligations. Foreign donors have curtailed this funding, however, in response to November 2008 electoral fraud. Managua has an IMF extended Credit Facility program, which could help keep the government's fiscal deficit on target during the 2011 election year and encourage transparency in the use of Venezuelan off-budget loans and assistance. In early 2004, Nicaragua secured some $4.5 billion in foreign debt reduction under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, however, Managua still struggles with a high public debt burden. Nicaragua is gradually recovering from the global economic crisis as increased exports drove positive growth in 2010.

This dynamic growth has boosted real incomes - but left behind some at the bottom of the ladder - and broadened and deepened the technological capabilities of the industrial sector. Per capita income rose for ten consecutive years until 2007 in purchasing power parity terms, but fell in 2008-09. Debt-driven consumer spending drove robust growth in the first half of the decade, helping fuel a large balance of payments deficit that posed a challenge for economic managers. Inflationary pressures caused the central bank to raise its key rate steadily from January 2004 until it was among the highest in the OECD in 2007-08; international capital inflows attracted to the high rates further strengthened the currency and housing market, however, aggravating the current account deficit. The economy fell into recession before the start of the global financial crisis and contracted for five consecutive quarters in 2008-09. In line with global peers, the central bank cut interest rates aggressively and the government developed fiscal stimulus measures. The economy posted a 1.7% decline in 2009, but pulled out of recession late in the year, and achieved 2.1% growth in 2010. Nevertheless, key trade sectors remain vulnerable to weak external demand. The government plans to raise productivity growth and develop infrastructure, while reining in government spending.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":117800000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":140400000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":1.5,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":4.6,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":24,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":71.4,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":2320000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":7,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":19,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":74,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":6.5,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":"%NA","highest 10%:":"%NA"},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":36.2,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":19.6,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":56240000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":62180000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":25.5,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":2.6,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":2.5,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":10.39,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":24150000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":118100000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":206200000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":67060000000},"Agriculture - products":"dairy products, lamb and mutton; wheat, barley, potatoes, pulses, fruits, vegetables; wool, beef; fish","Industries":"food processing, wood and paper products, textiles, machinery, transportation equipment, banking and insurance, tourism, mining","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":2,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":42400000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":39240000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":61150,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":154100,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":54560,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":143900,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":60000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":4305000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":4320000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":"NA","Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":33979999999.999996,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-4.504 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":33240000000.000004},"Exports - commodities":"dairy products, meat, wood and wood products, fish, machinery","Exports - partners":"Australia 23.36%, US 9.64%, China 9.21%, Japan 7.1%, UK 4.21% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":30240000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery and equipment, vehicles and aircraft, petroleum, electronics, textiles, plastics","Imports - partners":"Australia 18.4%, China 15.09%, US 10.45%, Japan 7.24%, Germany 4.16%, Singapore 4.12% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":17850000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":64330000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":67180000000.00001},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA (31 December 2009)","Exchange rates":"New Zealand dollars (NZD) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"oo","name":"Southern Ocean","background":"A large body of recent oceanographic research has shown that the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), an ocean current that flows from west to east around Antarctica, plays a crucial role in global ocean circulation. The region where the cold waters of the ACC meet and mingle with the warmer waters of the north defines a distinct border - the Antarctic Convergence - which fluctuates with the seasons, but which encompasses a discrete body of water and a unique ecologic region. The Convergence concentrates nutrients, which promotes marine plant life, and which in turn allows for a greater abundance of animal life. In the spring of 2000, the International Hydrographic Organization decided to delimit the waters within the Convergence as a fifth world ocean - the Southern Ocean - by combining the southern portions of the Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, and Pacific Ocean. The Southern Ocean extends from the coast of Antarctica north to 60 degrees south latitude, which coincides with the Antarctic Treaty Limit and which approximates the extent of the Antarctic Convergence. As such, the Southern Ocean is now the fourth largest of the world's five oceans (after the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, and Indian Ocean, but larger than the Arctic Ocean). It should be noted that inclusion of the Southern Ocean does not imply recognition of this feature as one of the world's primary oceans by the US Government.","geo":{"Location":"body of water between 60 degrees south latitude and Antarctica","Geographic coordinates":"60 00 S, 90 00 E (nominally), but the Southern Ocean has the unique distinction of being a large circumpolar body of water totally encircling the continent of Antarctica;

Because of the importance of the informal sector, accurate economic measures are difficult to obtain. On a per capita basis, real income has stagnated at 1980 levels. The economy grew rapidly between 2003 and 2008 as growing world demand for commodities combined with high prices and favorable weather to support Paraguay's commodity-based export expansion. Paraguay is the sixth largest soy producer in the world. Drought hit in 2008, reducing agricultural exports and slowing the economy even before the onset of the global recession. The economy fell 3.8% in 2009, as lower world demand and commodity prices caused exports to contract. The government reacted by introducing fiscal and monetary stimulus packages. Growth resumed at a 14.5% level in 2010, the highest in South America.

In October 2004, more than one-quarter of Pitcairn's small labor force was arrested, putting the economy in a bind, since their services were required as lighter crew to load or unload passing ships.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":"$NA","Labor force":"15 able-bodied men (2004)","Labor force - by occupation":{"note:":"no business community in the usual sense; some public works; subsistence farming and fishing"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":null},"expenditures:":{"usd":1028000}},"Agriculture - products":"honey; wide variety of fruits and vegetables; goats, chickens, fish","Industries":"postage stamps, handicrafts, beekeeping, honey","Electricity - production":"NA kWh; note - electric power is provided by a small diesel-powered generator","Exports":"$NA","Exports - commodities":"fruits, vegetables, curios, stamps","Imports":"$NA","Imports - commodities":"fuel oil, machinery, building materials, flour, sugar, other foodstuffs","Exchange rates":"New Zealand dollars (NZD) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"pe","name":"Peru","region":"South America","background":"Ancient Peru was the seat of several prominent Andean civilizations, most notably that of the Incas whose empire was captured by the Spanish conquistadors in 1533. Peruvian independence was declared in 1821, and remaining Spanish forces were defeated in 1824. After a dozen years of military rule, Peru returned to democratic leadership in 1980, but experienced economic problems and the growth of a violent insurgency. President Alberto FUJIMORI's election in 1990 ushered in a decade that saw a dramatic turnaround in the economy and significant progress in curtailing guerrilla activity. Nevertheless, the president's increasing reliance on authoritarian measures and an economic slump in the late 1990s generated mounting dissatisfaction with his regime, which led to his ouster in 2000. A caretaker government oversaw new elections in the spring of 2001, which ushered in Alejandro TOLEDO Manrique as the new head of government - Peru's first democratically elected president of Native American ethnicity. The presidential election of 2006 saw the return of Alan GARCIA Perez who, after a disappointing presidential term from 1985 to 1990, has overseen a robust macroeconomic performance.","geo":{"Location":"Western South America, bordering the South Pacific Ocean, between Chile and Ecuador","Geographic coordinates":{"S":{"deg":10,"min":0},"W":{"deg":76,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total:":{"quantity":1285,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world:":"","land:":{"quantity":1279,"unit":"sq km"},"water:":{"quantity":5220,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than Alaska","Land boundaries":{"total:":{"quantity":7461,"unit":"km"},"border countries:":"Bolivia 1,075 km, Brazil 2,995 km, Chile 171 km, Colombia 1,800 km, Ecuador 1,420 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":2414,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea:":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf:":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"}},"Climate":"varies from tropical in east to dry desert in west;

Abundant mineral resources are found in the mountainous areas, and Peru's coastal waters provide excellent fishing grounds. The Peruvian economy grew by almost 6% per year during the period 2002-06, with a stable exchange rate and low inflation. Growth jumped to nearly 9% per year in 2007 and 10% in 2008, driven by private investment and government spending, but then fell to less than 1% in 2009 in the face of the world recession, a sharp fall of private investment, and a substantial increase in counter-cyclical government spending. Growth resumed in 2010 at above 8%, due partly to a leap in private investment and continued high government spending. Peru's rapid expansion coupled with the government's conditional cash transfers and other programs have helped to reduce the national poverty rate by over 19 percentage points since 2002, though underemployment remains high. Inflation in 2010 was within the Central Bank's 1%-3% target range. Despite Peru's strong macroeconomic performance, dependence on minerals and metals exports and imported foodstuffs subjects the economy to fluctuations in world prices. Poor infrastructure hinders the spread of growth to Peru's non-coastal areas. A growing number of Peruvians are sharing in the benefits of growth but despite President GARCIA's pursuit of sound trade and macroeconomic policies, inequality persists. Nevertheless, he remains committed to Peru's free-trade path. Since 2006, Peru has signed trade deals with the United States, Canada, Singapore, China, Korea, and Japan, concluded negotiations with the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and Chile, and begun trade talks with Central American countries and others. The US-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement (PTPA) entered into force 1 February 2009, opening the way to greater trade and investment between the two economies. Rising world prices of foodstuffs and fuel, coupled with strong domestic demand, are immediate concerns for 2011. Peru has continued to attract foreign investment. However, political disputes may impede development of some projects related to natural resource extraction.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":275700000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":152800000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":8.8,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":10,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":35,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":55,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":15680000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":0.7,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":23.8,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":75.5,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":7.9,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":34.8,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":1.5,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":37.9,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":49.6,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":25.1,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":30530000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":29720000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":23.9,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1.5,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":3.8,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":3.63,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":15260000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":55200000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":44200000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":160900000000},"Agriculture - products":"asparagus, coffee, cocoa, cotton, sugarcane, rice, potatoes, corn, plantains, grapes, oranges, pineapples, guavas, bananas, apples, lemons, pears, coca, tomatoes, mango, barley, medicinal plants, palm oil, marigold, onion, wheat, dry beans; poultry, beef, dairy products; fish; guinea pigs","Industries":"mining and refining of minerals; steel, metal fabrication; petroleum extraction and refining, natural gas and natural gas liquefaction; fishing and fish processing, cement, textiles, clothing, food processing","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":8.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":35790000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":31740000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":111900000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":157200,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":150700,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":68640,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":88080,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":1163000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":7240000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":3650000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":3590000000,"unit":"cu m"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":453000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-2.315 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":35560000000},"Exports - commodities":"copper, gold, zinc, tin, iron ore, molybdenum; crude petroleum and petroleum products, natural gas; coffee, potatoes, asparagus and other vegetables, fruit, apparel and textiles, fishmeal","Exports - partners":"US 16.98%, China 15.3%, Switzerland 14.85%, Canada 8.67%, Japan 5.14% (2010 est.)","Imports":{"usd":25740000000},"Imports - commodities":"petroleum and petroleum products, chemicals, plastics, machinery, vehicles, color TV sets, power shovels, front-end loaders, telephones and telecommunication equipment, iron and steel, wheat, corn, soybean products, paper, cotton, vaccines and medicines","Imports - partners":"US 19.72%, China 15%, Brazil 7.77%, Ecuador 4.9%, Chile 4.6%, Colombia 4.4%, Japan 4.1% (2010 est.)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":44110000000},"Debt - external":{"Debt - external":{"usd":33290000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":43470000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":2120000000},"Exchange rates":"nuevo sol (PEN) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"pf","name":"Paracel Islands","region":"East & Southeast Asia","background":"The Paracel Islands are surrounded by productive fishing grounds and by potential oil and gas reserves.

The area underwent successive invasions in subsequent centuries from the Persians, Greeks, Scythians, Arabs (who brought Islam), Afghans, and Turks. The Mughal Empire flourished in the 16th and 17th centuries; the British came to dominate the region in the 18th century. The separation in 1947 of British India into the Muslim state of Pakistan (with West and East sections) and largely Hindu India was never satisfactorily resolved, and India and Pakistan fought two wars - in 1947-48 and 1965 - over the disputed Kashmir territory. A third war between these countries in 1971 - in which India capitalized on Islamabad's marginalization of Bengalis in Pakistani politics - resulted in East Pakistan becoming the separate nation of Bangladesh. In response to Indian nuclear weapons testing, Pakistan conducted its own tests in 1998. India-Pakistan relations have been rocky since the November 2008 Mumbai attacks, but both countries are taking small steps to put relations back on track. In February 2008, Pakistan held parliamentary elections and in September 2008, after the resignation of former President MUSHARRAF, elected Asif Ali ZARDARI to the presidency.

Between 2001-07, however, poverty levels decreased by 10%, as Islamabad steadily raised development spending. During 2004-07, GDP growth in the 5-8% range was spurred by gains in the industrial and service sectors - despite severe electricity shortfalls - but growth slowed in 2008-09 and unemployment rose. Inflation remains the top concern among the public, climbing from 7.7% in 2007 to more than 13% in 2010. In addition, the Pakistani rupee has depreciated since 2007 as a result of political and economic instability. The government agreed to an International Monetary Fund Standby Arrangement in November 2008 in response to a balance of payments crisis, but during 2009-10 its current account strengthened and foreign exchange reserves stabilized - largely because of lower oil prices and record remittances from workers abroad. Record floods in July-August 2010 lowered agricultural output and contributed to a jump in inflation, and reconstruction costs will strain the limited resources of the government. Textiles account for most of Pakistan's export earnings, but Pakistan's failure to expand a viable export base for other manufactures has left the country vulnerable to shifts in world demand. Other long term challenges include expanding investment in education, healthcare, and electricity production, and reducing dependence on foreign donors.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":464900000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":174900000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":4.8,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":21.8,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":23.6,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":54.6,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":{"Labor force":55770000,"country comparison to the world:":""},"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":43,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":20.3,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":36.6,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":15,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":24,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":3.9,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":26.5,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":30.6,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":15,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":25330000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":36240000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":49.9,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":13.4,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":12.5,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":"NA%","Stock of narrow money":{"usd":59750000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":85220000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":71450000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":33240000000.000004},"Agriculture - products":"cotton, wheat, rice, sugarcane, fruits, vegetables; milk, beef, mutton, eggs","Industries":"textiles and apparel, food processing, pharmaceuticals, construction materials, paper products, fertilizer, shrimp","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":4.9,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":90800000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":72200000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":59140,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":373000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":30090,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":319500,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":436200000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":37500000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":37500000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":840200000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-2.641 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":20290000000},"Exports - commodities":"textiles (garments, bed linen, cotton cloth, yarn), rice, leather goods, sports goods, chemicals, manufactures, carpets and rugs","Exports - partners":"US 15.87%, UAE 12.35%, Afghanistan 8.48%, UK 4.7%, China 4.44% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":32710000000},"Imports - commodities":"petroleum, petroleum products, machinery, plastics, transportation equipment, edible oils, paper and paperboard, iron and steel, tea","Imports - partners":"China 15.35%, Saudi Arabia 10.54%, UAE 9.8%, US 4.81%, Kuwait 4.73%, Malaysia 4.43%, India 4.02% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":16100000000.000002},"Debt - external":{"usd":57210000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":30090000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":1046999999.9999999},"Exchange rates":"Pakistani rupees (PKR) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"pl","name":"Poland","region":"Europe","background":"Poland is an ancient nation that was conceived near the middle of the 10th century. Its golden age occurred in the 16th century. During the following century, the strengthening of the gentry and internal disorders weakened the nation. In a series of agreements between 1772 and 1795, Russia, Prussia, and Austria partitioned Poland among themselves. Poland regained its independence in 1918 only to be overrun by Germany and the Soviet Union in World War II. It became a Soviet satellite state following the war, but its government was comparatively tolerant and progressive. Labor turmoil in 1980 led to the formation of the independent trade union \"Solidarity\" that over time became a political force and by 1990 had swept parliamentary elections and the presidency. A \"shock therapy\" program during the early 1990s enabled the country to transform its economy into one of the most robust in Central Europe, but Poland still faces the lingering challenges of high unemployment, underdeveloped and dilapidated infrastructure, and a poor rural underclass. Poland joined NATO in 1999 and the European Union in 2004. With its transformation to a democratic, market-oriented country largely completed, Poland is an increasingly active member of Euro-Atlantic organizations.","geo":{"Location":"Central Europe, east of Germany","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":52,"min":0},"E":{"deg":20,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total:":{"quantity":312685,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world:":"","land:":{"quantity":304255,"unit":"sq km"},"water:":{"quantity":8430,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than New Mexico","Land boundaries":{"total:":{"quantity":3047,"unit":"km"},"border countries:":"Belarus 605 km, Czech Republic 615 km, Germany 456 km, Lithuania 91 km, Russia (Kaliningrad Oblast) 432 km, Slovakia 420 km, Ukraine 428 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":440,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea:":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone:":"defined by international treaties"},"Climate":"temperate with cold, cloudy, moderately severe winters with frequent precipitation;

It is the only country in the European Union to maintain positive GDP growth through the 2008-2009 economic downturn. GDP per capita is still much below the EU average, but is similar to that of the three Baltic states. Since 2004, EU membership and access to EU structural funds have provided a major boost to the economy. Unemployment fell rapidly to 6.4% in October 2008, but climbed back to 11.8% for the year 2010, exceeding the EU average by more than 2%. Inflation reached a low of about 2.6% in 2010 due to the global economic slowdown but has since climbed and is expected to remain around 3%, and close to the upper limit of the National Bank of Poland's target rate. Poland's economic performance could improve over the longer term if the country addresses some of the remaining deficiencies in its road and rail infrastructure and its business environment. An inefficient commercial court system, a rigid labor code, bureaucratic red tape, burdensome tax system, and persistent low-level corruption keep the private sector from performing up to its full potential. Rising demands to fund health care, education, and the state pension system caused the public sector budget deficit to rise to 7.9% of GDP in 2010. The PO/PSL coalition government, which came to power in November 2007, has planned to reduce the budget deficit in 2011 and has also announced its intention to enact business-friendly reforms, increase workforce participation, reduce public sector spending growth, lower taxes, and accelerate privatization. The government has moved slowly on most major reforms, but has sped up privatization.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":721300000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":468500000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":3.8,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":4,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":32,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":64,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":17000000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":17.4,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":29.2,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":53.4,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":11.8,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":17,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":27.2,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":34.9,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":19.5,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":91230000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":128400000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":53.6,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":2.6,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":3.5,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":5.99,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":138700000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":251900000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":288700000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":135300000000.00002},"Agriculture - products":"potatoes, fruits, vegetables, wheat; poultry, eggs, pork, dairy","Industries":"machine building, iron and steel, coal mining, chemicals, shipbuilding, food processing, glass, beverages, textiles","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":6.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":149100000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":129300000000.00002,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":9703000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":8480000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":34140,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":545400,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":65280,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":553900,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":96380000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":5842000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":16329999999.999998,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":40000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":9954000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":164800000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-12.33 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":160800000000},"Exports - commodities":"machinery and transport equipment 37.8%, intermediate manufactured goods 23.7%, miscellaneous manufactured goods 17.1%, food and live animals 7.6%","Exports - partners":"Germany 26.06%, Italy 6.84%, France 6.78%, UK 6.38%, Czech Republic 5.85%, Netherlands 4.14% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":167400000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery and transport equipment 38%, intermediate manufactured goods 21%, chemicals 15%, minerals, fuels, lubricants, and related materials 9%","Imports - partners":"Germany 28.08%, Russia 8.65%, Italy 6.5%, Netherlands 5.59%, China 5.27%, France 4.6%, Czech Republic 4.05% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":99760000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":252900000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":198800000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":30710000000},"Exchange rates":"zlotych (PLN) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"pm","name":"Panama","region":"Central America and Caribbean","background":"Explored and settled by the Spanish in the 16th century, Panama broke with Spain in 1821 and joined a union of Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela - named the Republic of Gran Colombia.

With US backing, Panama seceded from Colombia in 1903 and promptly signed a treaty with the US allowing for the construction of a canal and US sovereignty over a strip of land on either side of the structure (the Panama Canal Zone). The Panama Canal was built by the US Army Corps of Engineers between 1904 and 1914. In 1977, an agreement was signed for the complete transfer of the Canal from the US to Panama by the end of the century. Certain portions of the Zone and increasing responsibility over the Canal were turned over in the subsequent decades. With US help, dictator Manuel NORIEGA was deposed in 1989. The entire Panama Canal, the area supporting the Canal, and remaining US military bases were transferred to Panama by the end of 1999. In October 2006, Panamanians approved an ambitious plan (estimated to cost $5.3 billion) to expand the Canal.

Services include operating the Panama Canal, logistics, banking, the Colon Free Zone, insurance, container ports, flagship registry, and tourism. Economic growth will be bolstered by the Panama Canal expansion project that began in 2007 and is scheduled to be completed by 2014 at a cost of $5.3 billion - about 25% of current GDP. The expansion project will more than double the Canal's capacity, enabling it to accommodate ships that are too large to traverse the existing canal. The United States and China are the top users of the Canal. Panama also plans to construct a metro system in Panama City, valued at $1.2 billion and scheduled to be completed by 2014. Panama's booming transportation and logistics services sectors, along with aggressive infrastructure development projects, will likely lead the economy to continued growth in 2011. Strong economic performance has not translated into broadly shared prosperity, as Panama has the second worst income distribution in Latin America. About 30% of the population lives in poverty; however, from 2006 to 2010 poverty was reduced by 10 percentage points, while unemployment dropped from 12% to 6% of the labor force. Panama and the United States signed a Trade Promotion Agreement in June 2007, which, when implemented, will help promote the country's economic growth. Seeking removal from the Organization of Economic Development's gray-list of tax havens, Panama has also recently signed various double taxation treaties with other nations.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":44360000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":26780000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":7.5,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":5.8,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":16.6,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":77.6,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":{"Labor force":1557000,"country comparison to the world:":""},"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":17.6,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":8.8,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":73.6,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":6.5,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":25.6,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":0.8,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":41.4,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":51,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":26.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":6944000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":7051000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":40,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":3.5,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":8.302,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":5040000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":24170000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":23200000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":8048000000},"Agriculture - products":"bananas, rice, corn, coffee, sugarcane, vegetables; livestock; shrimp","Industries":"construction, brewing, cement and other construction materials, sugar milling","Industrial production growth rate":"-1% (September 2010, year-over-year)","Electricity - production":{"quantity":6546000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":5805000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":124900000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":8740000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":93000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":4803,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":87100,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-2.523 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"Exports":{"usd":12520000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Exports - commodities":"bananas, shrimp, sugar, coffee, clothing","Exports - partners":"Greece 21.03%, US 17.63%, Japan 9.87%, Germany 4.28%, Italy 4.27% (2009)","Imports":{"Imports":{"usd":16050000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Imports - commodities":"capital goods, foodstuffs, consumer goods, chemicals","Imports - partners":"Japan 36.21%, Singapore 16.86%, US 12.3%, China 7.84% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":3525000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":13850000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":"$NA","Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA","Exchange rates":{"Exchange rates":"balboas (PAB) per US dollar -"}}},{"id":"po","name":"Portugal","region":"Europe","background":"Following its heyday as a global maritime power during the 15th and 16th centuries, Portugal lost much of its wealth and status with the destruction of Lisbon in a 1755 earthquake, occupation during the Napoleonic Wars, and the independence of its wealthiest colony of Brazil in 1822.

Over the past two decades, successive governments have privatized many state-controlled firms and liberalized key areas of the economy, including the financial and telecommunications sectors. The country qualified for the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in 1998 and began circulating the euro on 1 January 2002 along with 11 other EU members. The economy had grown by more than the EU average for much of the 1990s, but fell back in 2001-08, and contracted 2.6% in 2009, before growing 1% in 2010. GDP per capita stands at roughly two-thirds of the EU-27 average. A poor educational system and a rigid labor market have been obstacles to greater productivity and growth. Portugal also has been increasingly overshadowed by lower-cost producers in Central Europe and Asia as a destination for foreign direct investment. Portugal's low competitiveness, low growth prospects, and high levels of public debt have made it vulnerable to bond market turbulence. The government is implementing austerity measures, including a 5% public salary cut which went into effect on January 1, 2011 and a 2% increase in the value-added tax, to reduce the budget deficit from 9.3% of GDP in 2009 to 4.6% in 2011, but some investors have expressed concern about the government's ability to achieve these targets and cover its sovereign debt. Without the option for stimulus measures, the government is focusing instead on boosting exports and implementing labor market reforms to try to raise GDP growth and increase Portugal's competitiveness - which, over time, may help mitigate investor concerns.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":247000000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":229300000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":1.4,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":2.6,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":23,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":74.5,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":5570000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":11.7,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":28.5,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":59.8,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":10.7,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":18,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":3.1,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":28.4,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":38.5,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":19,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":93610000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":110200000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":83.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1.1,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":1.75,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":6.12,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":98230000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":282000000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":556300000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":98650000000},"Agriculture - products":"grain, potatoes, tomatoes, olives, grapes; sheep, cattle, goats, pigs, poultry, dairy products; fish","Industries":"textiles, clothing, footwear, wood and cork, paper, chemicals, auto-parts manufacturing, base metals, dairy products, wine and other foods, porcelain and ceramics, glassware, technology, telecommunications; ship construction and refurbishment; tourism","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":0.9,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":44470000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":48780000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":1313000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":10740000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":4721,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":272200,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":53660,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":323000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":"NA","Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":4846000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":4895000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-19.03 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":46270000000},"Exports - commodities":"agricultural products, food products, wine, oil products, chemical products, plastics and rubber, hides, leather, wood and cork, wood pulp and paper, textile materials, clothing, footwear, machinery and tools","Exports - partners":"Spain 26.25%, Germany 12.99%, France 12.04%, Angola 7.21%, UK 5.54% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":68220000000},"Imports - commodities":"agricultural products, chemical products, vehicles and other transport material, and optical and precision instruments, computer accessories and parts, semi-conductors and related devices","Imports - partners":"Spain 31.58%, Germany 12.41%, France 8.58%, Italy 5.55%, Netherlands 5.31% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":"$NA (31 December 2010 est.)","Debt - external":{"usd":497800000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":105700000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":63640000000},"Exchange rates":"euros (EUR) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"pp","name":"Papua New Guinea","region":"East & Southeast Asia","background":"The eastern half of the island of New Guinea - second largest in the world - was divided between Germany (north) and the UK (south) in 1885.

The economy has a small formal sector, focused mainly on the export of those natural resources, and an informal sector, employing the majority of the population. Agriculture provides a subsistence livelihood for 85% of the people. Mineral deposits, including copper, gold, and oil, account for nearly two-thirds of export earnings. Natural gas reserves amount to an estimated 227 billion cubic meters. A consortium led by a major American oil company is constructing a liquefied natural gas (LNG) production facility that could begin exporting in 2014. As the largest investment project in the country's history, it has the potential to double GDP in the near-term and triple Papua New Guinea's export revenue. An American-owned firm also opened PNG's first oil refinery in 2004 and is building a second LNG production facility. The government faces the challenge of ensuring transparency and accountability for revenues flowing from this and other large LNG projects. The government of Prime Minister SOMARE has expended much of its energy remaining in power. He was the first prime minister ever to serve a full five-year term. The government has brought stability to the national budget, largely through expenditure control; however, it relaxed spending constraints in 2006 and 2007 as elections approached. In recent years, the government has opened up markets in telecommunications and air transport, making both more affordable to the people. Numerous challenges still face the government, including providing physical security for foreign investors, regaining investor confidence, restoring integrity to state institutions, promoting economic efficiency by privatizing moribund state institutions, and balancing relations with Australia, its former colonial ruler. Other socio-cultural challenges could upend the economy including an HIV/AIDS epidemic, with the second highest infection rate in all of East Asia and the Pacific, and chronic law and order and land tenure issues. The global financial crisis had little impact because of continued foreign demand for PNG's commodities.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":14950000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":9668000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":7,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":32.2,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":35.7,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":32.1,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":3809000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":85,"unit":"%"},"industry:":"NA%","services:":"NA% (2005 est.)"},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":1.8,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":37,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":1.7,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":40.5,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":50.9,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":17.3,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":2917000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":2765000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":27.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":6.8,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":6.92,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":10.09,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":2551000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":4726000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":2796000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA (31 December 2010)","Agriculture - products":"coffee, cocoa, copra, palm kernels, tea, sugar, rubber, sweet potatoes, fruit, vegetables, vanilla; shell fish; poultry, pork","Industries":"copra crushing, palm oil processing, plywood production, wood chip production; mining of gold, silver, and copper; crude oil production, petroleum refining; construction, tourism","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":10,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":2885000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":2683000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":35090,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":36000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":32490,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":14380,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":170000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":100000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":100000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":226500000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-99 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":5976000000},"Exports - commodities":"oil, gold, copper ore, logs, palm oil, coffee, cocoa, crayfish, prawns","Exports - partners":"Australia 30.05%, Japan 7.48% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":3547000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery and transport equipment, manufactured goods, food, fuels, chemicals","Imports - partners":"Australia 43.27%, China 13.29%, Singapore 9.59%, US 6.4%, Japan 4.62% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":3017000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":1548000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":"$NA","Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA","Exchange rates":"kina (PGK) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"ps","name":"Palau","region":"Australia-Oceania","background":"After three decades as part of the UN Trust Territory of the Pacific under US administration, this westernmost cluster of the Caroline Islands opted for independence in 1978 rather than join the Federated States of Micronesia.

Several coup attempts through the 1980s and early 1990s failed to unseat him. In 1994 VIEIRA was elected president in the country's first free elections. A military mutiny and resulting civil war in 1998 eventually led to VIEIRA's ouster in May 1999. In February 2000, a transitional government turned over power to opposition leader Kumba YALA after he was elected president in transparent polling. In September 2003, after only three years in office, YALA was ousted by the military in a bloodless coup, and businessman Henrique ROSA was sworn in as interim president. In 2005, former President VIEIRA was re-elected president pledging to pursue economic development and national reconciliation; he was assassinated in March 2009.

Qatari authorities throughout the crisis sought to protect the local banking sector with direct investments into domestic banks. GDP rebounded in 2010 largely due to the increase in oil prices. Economic policy is focused on developing Qatar's nonassociated natural gas reserves and increasing private and foreign investment in non-energy sectors, but oil and gas still account for more than 50% of GDP, roughly 85% of export earnings, and 70% of government revenues. Oil and gas likely have made Qatar the highest per-capita income country - ahead of Liechtenstein - and the country with the lowest unemployment.

Various paramilitary bands resisted Nazi Germany's occupation and division of Yugoslavia from 1941 to 1945, but fought each other and ethnic opponents as much as the invaders. The military and political movement headed by Josip \"TITO\" Broz (Partisans) took full control of Yugoslavia when German and Croatian separatist forces were defeated in 1945. Although Communist, TITO's new government and his successors (he died in 1980) managed to steer their own path between the Warsaw Pact nations and the West for the next four and a half decades. In 1989, Slobodan MILOSEVIC became president of the Republic of Serbia and his ultranationalist calls for Serbian domination led to the violent breakup of Yugoslavia along ethnic lines. In 1991, Croatia, Slovenia, and Macedonia declared independence, followed by Bosnia in 1992. The remaining republics of Serbia and Montenegro declared a new Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) in April 1992 and under MILOSEVIC's leadership, Serbia led various military campaigns to unite ethnic Serbs in neighboring republics into a \"Greater Serbia.\" These actions were ultimately unsuccessful and led to the signing of the Dayton Peace Accords in 1995. MILOSEVIC retained control over Serbia and eventually became president of the FRY in 1997. In 1998, an ethnic Albanian insurgency in the formerly autonomous Serbian province of Kosovo provoked a Serbian counterinsurgency campaign that resulted in massacres and massive expulsions of ethnic Albanians living in Kosovo. The MILOSEVIC government's rejection of a proposed international settlement led to NATO's bombing of Serbia in the spring of 1999, to the withdrawal of Serbian military and police forces from Kosovo in June 1999, and to the stationing of a NATO-led force in Kosovo to provide a safe and secure environment for the region's ethnic communities. FRY elections in late 2000 led to the ouster of MILOSEVIC and the installation of democratic government. In 2003, the FRY became Serbia and Montenegro, a loose federation of the two republics. Widespread violence predominantly targeting ethnic Serbs in Kosovo in March 2004 caused the international community to open negotiations on the future status of Kosovo in January 2006. In June 2006, Montenegro seceded from the federation and declared itself an independent nation. Serbia subsequently gave notice that it was the successor state to the union of Serbia and Montenegro. In February 2008, after nearly two years of inconclusive negotiations, the UN-administered province of Kosovo declared itself independent of Serbia - an action Serbia refuses to recognize. At Serbia's request, the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in October 2008 sought an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on whether Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence was in accordance with international law. In a ruling considered unfavorable to Serbia, the ICJ issued an advisory opinion in July 2010 stating that international law did not prohibit declarations of independence. In late 2010, Serbia agreed to an EU-drafted UNGA Resolution acknowledging the ICJ's decision and calling for a new round of talks between Serbia and Kosovo.","geo":{"Location":"Southeastern Europe, between Macedonia and Hungary","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":44,"min":0},"E":{"deg":21,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total:":{"quantity":77474,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world:":"","land:":{"quantity":77474,"unit":"sq km"},"water:":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than South Carolina","Land boundaries":{"total:":{"quantity":2026,"unit":"km"},"border countries:":"Bosnia and Herzegovina 302 km, Bulgaria 318 km, Croatia 241 km, Hungary 151 km, Kosovo 352 km, Macedonia 62 km, Montenegro 124 km, Romania 476 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":"none (landlocked)","Climate":"in the north, continental climate (cold winters and hot, humid summers with well distributed rainfall);

After the ousting of former Federal Yugoslav President MILOSEVIC in September 2000, the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS) coalition government implemented stabilization measures and embarked on a market reform program. After renewing its membership in the IMF in December 2000, Yugoslavia continued to reintegrate into the international community by rejoining the World Bank (IBRD) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). Belgrade has made progress in trade liberalization and enterprise restructuring and privatization, including telecommunications and small- and medium-size firms. It has made some progress towards EU membership, signing a Stabilization and Association Agreement with Brussels in May 2008, and with full implementation of the Interim Trade Agreement with the EU in February 2010. Serbia is also pursuing membership in the World Trade Organization. Structural economic reforms needed to ensure the country's long-term viability have largely stalled since the onset of the global financial crisis. Serbia, however, is slowly recovering from the crisis. Economic growth in 2010 was a modest 1.7%, following a 3.1% contraction in 2009, but exports rose by over 16% and manufacturing output increased 3.2%. High unemployment and stagnant household incomes are ongoing political and economic problems. Serbia signed an augmented $4 billion Stand By Arrangement with the IMF in May 2009 that expires in April 2011. IMF conditions on Serbia constrain the use of stimulus efforts to revive the economy, while Serbia's concerns about inflation and exchange rate stability preclude the use of expansionary monetary policy. Serbia adopted a new long-term economic growth plan in 2010 that calls for a quadrupling of exports over ten years and heavy investments in basic infrastructure. Serbia is still a transitional economy with unfinished privatization and incomplete structural reforms. Major challenges ahead include: high government expenditures for salaries, pensions and unemployment; a growing need for new government borrowing; rising public and private foreign debt; and stagnant levels of foreign direct investment. Privatization revenues have fallen precipitously in recent years, while a high percentage of economic activity remains in the hands of the state. Other serious challenges include an inefficient judicial system, high levels of corruption, and an aging population. Factors favorable to Serbia's economic growth include a strategic location, a relatively inexpensive and skilled labor force, and a generous package of incentives for foreign investments.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":80100000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":38710000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":1.8,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":12.6,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":21.9,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":65.5,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":2950000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":23.9,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":20.5,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":55.6,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":19.2,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":8.8,"unit":"%"},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":26,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":25.9,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":16469999999.999998},"expenditures:":{"usd":18480000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":41.5,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":10.3,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":12,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":13.28,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":3060000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":17680000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":20030000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":12370000000},"Agriculture - products":"wheat, maize, sugar beets, sunflower, raspberries; beef, pork, milk","Industries":"base metals, furniture, food processing, machinery, chemicals, sugar, tires, clothes, pharmaceuticals","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":3.2,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":35900000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":34100000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":1300000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":770000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":11400,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":90000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":5045,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":78600,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":77500000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":356000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":2350000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":2000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":48140000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-1.046 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":9700000000},"Exports - commodities":"iron and steel, rubber, clothes, wheat, fruit and vegetables, nonferrous metals, electric appliances, metal products, weapons and ammunition","Exports - partners":"Italy 11.5%, Bosnia and Herzegovina 11.2%, Germany 10.5%, Montenegro 8.4%, Romania 6.3%, Russia 5.4%, Macedonia 4.9%, Slovenia 4.4% (2010 est.)","Imports":{"usd":15780000000},"Imports - partners":"Russia 12.8%, Germany 10.6%, Italy 8.5%, China 7.2%, Hungary 4.9% (2010 est.)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":15100000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":30900000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":23520000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA","Exchange rates":"Serbian dinars (RSD) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"rm","name":"Marshall Islands","region":"Australia-Oceania","background":"After almost four decades under US administration as the easternmost part of the UN Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, the Marshall Islands attained independence in 1986 under a Compact of Free Association.

The Spanish retook the island in 1633, but continued to be harassed by the Dutch. The Spanish finally relinquished Saint Martin to the French and Dutch, who divided it between themselves in 1648. Friction between the two sides caused the border to frequently fluctuate over the next two centuries, with the French eventually holding the greater portion of the island (about 57%). The cultivation of sugar cane introduced slavery to the island in the late 18th century; the practice was not abolished until 1848.

Domestic consumption and investment have fueled strong GDP growth in recent years, but have led to large current account imbalances. Romania's macroeconomic gains have only recently started to spur creation of a middle class and address Romania's widespread poverty. Corruption and red tape continue to handicap its business environment. Inflation rose in 2007-08, driven in part by strong consumer demand and high wage growth, rising energy costs, a nation-wide drought affecting food prices, and a relaxation of fiscal discipline. Romania's GDP contracted markedly in the last quarter of 2008 as the country began to feel the effects of a global downturn in financial markets and trade, and GDP fell more than 7% in 2009, prompting Bucharest to seek a $26 billion emergency assistance package from the IMF, the EU, and other international lenders. Drastic austerity measures, as part of Romania's IMF-led agreement led to a further 1.9% GDP contraction in 2010.

In 1935 the Philippines became a self-governing commonwealth. Manuel QUEZON was elected president and was tasked with preparing the country for independence after a 10-year transition. In 1942 the islands fell under Japanese occupation during World War II, and US forces and Filipinos fought together during 1944-45 to regain control. On 4 July 1946 the Republic of the Philippines attained its independence. A 20-year rule by Ferdinand MARCOS ended in 1986, when a \"people power\" movement in Manila (\"EDSA 1\") forced him into exile and installed Corazon AQUINO as president. Her presidency was hampered by several coup attempts that prevented a return to full political stability and economic development. Fidel RAMOS was elected president in 1992. His administration was marked by increased stability and by progress on economic reforms. In 1992, the US closed its last military bases on the islands. Joseph ESTRADA was elected president in 1998. He was succeeded by his vice-president, Gloria MACAPAGAL-ARROYO, in January 2001 after ESTRADA's stormy impeachment trial on corruption charges broke down and another \"people power\" movement (\"EDSA 2\") demanded his resignation. MACAPAGAL-ARROYO was elected to a six-year term as president in May 2004. Her presidency was marred by several corruption allegations but the Philippine economy was one of the few to avoid contraction following the 2008 global financial crisis, expanding each year of her administration. Benigno AQUINO III was elected to a six-year term as president in May 2010. The Philippine Government faces threats from several groups on the US Government's Foreign Terrorist Organization list. Manila has waged a decades-long struggle against ethnic Moro insurgencies in the southern Philippines, which has led to a peace accord with the Moro National Liberation Front and on-again/off-again peace talks with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front. The decades-long Maoist-inspired New People's Army insurgency also operates through much of the country.","geo":{"Location":"Southeastern Asia, archipelago between the Philippine Sea and the South China Sea, east of Vietnam","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":13,"min":0},"E":{"deg":122,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total:":{"quantity":300000,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world:":"","land:":{"quantity":298170,"unit":"sq km"},"water:":{"quantity":1830,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly larger than Arizona","Land boundaries":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":36289,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea:":"irregular polygon extending up to 100 nm from coastline as defined by 1898 treaty;

The economy weathered the 2008-09 global recession better than its regional peers due to minimal exposure to troubled international securities, lower dependence on exports, relatively resilient domestic consumption, large remittances from four- to five-million overseas Filipino workers, and a growing business process outsourcing industry. Economic growth in the Philippines averaged 4.5% during the MACAPAGAL-ARROYO administration. Despite this growth, poverty worsened, because of a high population growth rate and inequitable distribution of income. The AQUINO administration is working to reduce the government deficit from 3.9% of GDP, when it took office, to 2% of GDP by 2013. The government has had little difficulty issuing debt both locally and internationally to finance the deficits. AQUINO's first budget emphasizes education, health, conditional cash transfers for the poor, and other social spending programs, relying on the private sector to finance important infrastructure projects. Weak tax collection, exacerbated by new tax breaks and incentives, has limited the government's ability to address major challenges. The AQUINO administration has vowed to focus on improving tax collection efficiency - rather than imposing new taxes - as a part of its good governance platform.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":351400000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":188700000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":7.3,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":13.9,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":31.3,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":54.8,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":38900000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":33,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":15,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":52,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":7.3,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":32.9,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":2.4,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":31.2,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":45.8,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":16,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":26840000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":33820000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":56.5,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":3.8,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":4,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":5.39,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":30650000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":97350000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":97630000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":202300000000},"Agriculture - products":"sugarcane, coconuts, rice, corn, bananas, cassavas, pineapples, mangoes; pork, eggs, beef; fish","Industries":"electronics assembly, garments, footwear, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, wood products, food processing, petroleum refining, fishing","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":12.1,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":61930000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":54400000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":9671,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":307200,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":28900,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":338400,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":168000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":2940000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":2940000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":108700000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":9510000000},"Exports":{"usd":50720000000},"Exports - commodities":"semiconductors and electronic products, transport equipment, garments, copper products, petroleum products, coconut oil, fruits","Exports - partners":"US 17.6%, Japan 16.2%, Netherlands 9.8%, Hong Kong 8.6%, China 7.7%, Germany 6.5%, Singapore 6.2%, South Korea 4.8% (2009 est.)","Imports":{"usd":59900000000},"Imports - commodities":"electronic products, mineral fuels, machinery and transport equipment, iron and steel, textile fabrics, grains, chemicals, plastic","Imports - partners":"Japan 12.5%, US 12%, China 8.8%, Singapore 8.7%, South Korea 7.9%, Taiwan 7.1%, Thailand 5.7% (2009 est.)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":62370000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":59770000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":24500000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":6495000000},"Exchange rates":"Philippine pesos (PHP) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"rq","name":"Puerto Rico","region":"Central America and Caribbean","background":"Populated for centuries by aboriginal peoples, the island was claimed by the Spanish Crown in 1493 following COLUMBUS' second voyage to the Americas.

In the early 17th century, a new Romanov Dynasty continued this policy of expansion across Siberia to the Pacific. Under PETER I (ruled 1682-1725), hegemony was extended to the Baltic Sea and the country was renamed the Russian Empire. During the 19th century, more territorial acquisitions were made in Europe and Asia. Defeat in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05 contributed to the Revolution of 1905, which resulted in the formation of a parliament and other reforms. Repeated devastating defeats of the Russian army in World War I led to widespread rioting in the major cities of the Russian Empire and to the overthrow in 1917 of the imperial household. The Communists under Vladimir LENIN seized power soon after and formed the USSR. The brutal rule of Iosif STALIN (1928-53) strengthened Communist rule and Russian dominance of the Soviet Union at a cost of tens of millions of lives. The Soviet economy and society stagnated in the following decades until General Secretary Mikhail GORBACHEV (1985-91) introduced glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring) in an attempt to modernize Communism, but his initiatives inadvertently released forces that by December 1991 splintered the USSR into Russia and 14 other independent republics. Since then, Russia has shifted its post-Soviet democratic ambitions in favor of a centralized semi-authoritarian state whose legitimacy is buttressed, in part, by carefully managed national elections, former President PUTIN's genuine popularity, and the prudent management of Russia's windfall energy wealth. Russia has severely disabled a Chechen rebel movement, although violence still occurs throughout the North Caucasus.","geo":{"Location":"Northern Asia (the area west of the Urals is considered part of Europe), bordering the Arctic Ocean, between Europe and the North Pacific Ocean","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":60,"min":0},"E":{"deg":100,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total:":{"quantity":17098,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world:":"","land:":{"quantity":16377,"unit":"sq km"},"water:":{"quantity":720500,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"approximately 1.8 times the size of the US","Land boundaries":{"total:":{"quantity":20241.5,"unit":"km"},"border countries:":"Azerbaijan 284 km, Belarus 959 km, China (southeast) 3,605 km, China (south) 40 km, Estonia 290 km, Finland 1,313 km, Georgia 723 km, Kazakhstan 6,846 km, North Korea 17.5 km, Latvia 292 km, Lithuania (Kaliningrad Oblast) 227 km, Mongolia 3,441 km, Norway 196 km, Poland (Kaliningrad Oblast) 432 km, Ukraine 1,576 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":37653,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea:":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone:":{"quantity":24,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone:":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf:":"200 m depth or to the depth of exploitation"},"Climate":"ranges from steppes in the south through humid continental in much of European Russia;

Economic reforms in the 1990s privatized most industry, with notable exceptions in the energy and defense-related sectors. The protection of property rights is still weak and the private sector remains subject to heavy state interference. Russian industry is primarily split between globally-competitive commodity producers - in 2009 Russia was the world's largest exporter of natural gas, the second largest exporter of oil, and the third largest exporter of steel and primary aluminum - and other less competitive heavy industries that remain dependent on the Russian domestic market. This reliance on commodity exports makes Russia vulnerable to boom and bust cycles that follow the highly volatile swings in global commodity prices. The government since 2007 has embarked on an ambitious program to reduce this dependency and build up the country's high technology sectors, but with few results so far. The economy had averaged 7% growth since the 1998 Russian financial crisis, resulting in a doubling of real disposable incomes and the emergence of a middle class. The Russian economy, however, was one of the hardest hit by the 2008-09 global economic crisis as oil prices plummeted and the foreign credits that Russian banks and firms relied on dried up. The Central Bank of Russia spent one-third of its $600 billion international reserves, the world's third largest, in late 2008 to slow the devaluation of the ruble. The government also devoted $200 billion in a rescue plan to increase liquidity in the banking sector and aid Russian firms unable to roll over large foreign debts coming due. The economic decline bottomed out in mid-2009 and the economy began to grow in the first quarter of 2010. However, a severe drought and fires in central Russia reduced agricultural output, prompting a ban on grain exports for part of the year, and slowed growth in other sectors such as manufacturing and retail trade. High oil prices buoyed Russian growth in the first quarter of 2011 and could help Russia reduce the budget deficit inherited from the lean years of 2008-09, but inflation and increased government expenditures may limit the positive impact of these revenues. Russia's long-term challenges include a shrinking workforce, a high level of corruption, difficulty in accessing capital for smaller, non-energy companies, and poor infrastructure in need of large investments.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":2223000000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":1465000000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":4,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":4.2,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":33.8,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":62,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":75550000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":10,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":31.9,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":58.1,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":7.6,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":13.1,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":1.9,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":30.4,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":42.2,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":18.9,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":262000000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":341100000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":9.5,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":6.7,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":8.75,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":15.31,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":269100000000.00003},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":650700000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":549900000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":861400000000},"Agriculture - products":"grain, sugar beets, sunflower seed, vegetables, fruits; beef, milk","Industries":"complete range of mining and extractive industries producing coal, oil, gas, chemicals, and metals; all forms of machine building from rolling mills to high-performance aircraft and space vehicles; defense industries including radar, missile production, and advanced electronic components, shipbuilding; road and rail transportation equipment; communications equipment; agricultural machinery, tractors, and construction equipment; electric power generating and transmitting equipment; medical and scientific instruments; consumer durables, textiles, foodstuffs, handicrafts","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":8.3,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":925900000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":857600000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":17700000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":3066000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":10120000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":2740000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":5430000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":42000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":74200000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":583600000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":439600000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":179100000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":35100000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":47570000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":68850000000},"Exports":{"usd":376700000000},"Exports - commodities":"petroleum and petroleum products, natural gas, metals, wood and wood products, chemicals, and a wide variety of civilian and military manufactures","Exports - partners":"Netherlands 10.62%, Italy 6.46%, Germany 6.24%, China 5.69%, Turkey 4.3%, Ukraine 4.01% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":237300000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery, vehicles, pharmaceutical products, plastic, semi-finished metal products, meat, fruits and nuts, optical and medical instruments, iron, steel","Imports - partners":"Germany 14.39%, China 13.98%, Ukraine 5.48%, Italy 4.84%, US 4.46% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":483100000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":480200000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":306800000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":260500000000},"Exchange rates":"Russian rubles (RUB) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"rw","name":"Rwanda","region":"Africa","background":"In 1959, three years before independence from Belgium, the majority ethnic group, the Hutus, overthrew the ruling Tutsi king.

The children of these exiles later formed a rebel group, the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), and began a civil war in 1990. The war, along with several political and economic upheavals, exacerbated ethnic tensions, culminating in April 1994 in a state-orchestrated genocide, in which Rwandans killed up to a million of their fellow citizens, including approximately three-quarters of the Tutsi population. The genocide ended later that same year when the predominantly Tutsi RPF, operating out of Uganda and northern Rwanda, defeated the national army and Hutu militias, and established an RPF-led government of national unity. Approximately 2 million Hutu refugees - many fearing Tutsi retribution - fled to neighboring Burundi, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zaire. Since then, most of the refugees have returned to Rwanda, but several thousand remained in the neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC; the former Zaire) and formed an extremist insurgency bent on retaking Rwanda, much as the RPF tried in 1990. Rwanda held its first local elections in 1999 and its first post-genocide presidential and legislative elections in 2003. Rwanda in 2009 staged a joint military operation with the Congolese Army in DRC to rout out the Hutu extremist insurgency there and Kigali and Kinshasa restored diplomatic relations. Rwanda also joined the Commonwealth in late 2009.","geo":{"Location":"Central Africa, east of Democratic Republic of the Congo","Geographic coordinates":{"S":{"deg":2,"min":0},"E":{"deg":30,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total:":{"quantity":26338,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world:":"","land:":{"quantity":24668,"unit":"sq km"},"water:":{"quantity":1670,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than Maryland","Land boundaries":{"total:":{"quantity":893,"unit":"km"},"border countries:":"Burundi 290 km, Democratic Republic of the Congo 217 km, Tanzania 217 km, Uganda 169 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":"none (landlocked)","Climate":"temperate;

Tourism is now Rwanda's primary foreign exchange earner and in 2008, minerals overtook coffee and tea as Rwanda's primary export. Minerals exports declined 40% in 2009-10 due to the global economic downturn. The 1994 genocide decimated Rwanda's fragile economic base, severely impoverished the population, particularly women, and temporarily stalled the country's ability to attract private and external investment. However, Rwanda has made substantial progress in stabilizing and rehabilitating its economy to pre-1994 levels. GDP has rebounded with an average annual growth of 7-8% since 2003 and inflation has been reduced to single digits. Nonetheless, a significant percent of the population still live below the official poverty line. Despite Rwanda's fertile ecosystem, food production often does not keep pace with demand, requiring food imports. Agricultural production has increased significantly over the last three years and last year Rwanda was self sufficient in food production. Rwanda continues to receive substantial aid money and obtained IMF-World Bank Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative debt relief in 2005-06. In recognition of Rwanda's successful management of its macro economy, in 2010, the IMF graduated Rwanda to a Policy Support Instrument (PSI). Rwanda also received a Millennium Challenge Threshold Program in 2008. Africa's most densely populated country is trying to overcome the limitations of its small, landlocked economy by leveraging regional trade. Rwanda joined the East African Community and is aligning its budget, trade, and immigration policies with its regional partners. The government has embraced an expansionary fiscal policy to reduce poverty by improving education, infrastructure, and foreign and domestic investment and pursuing market-oriented reforms. Energy shortages, instability in neighboring states, and lack of adequate transportation linkages to other countries continue to handicap private sector growth. The Rwandan government is seeking to become regional leader in information and communication technologies. In 2010, Rwanda neared completion of the first modern Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in Kigali. The SEZ seeks to attract investment in all sectors, but specifically in agribusiness, information and communications technologies, trade and logistics, mining, and construction. The global downturn hurt export demand and tourism, but economic growth is recovering, driven in large part by the services sector, and inflation has been contained. On the back of this growth, government is gradually ending its fiscal stimulus policy while protecting aid to the poor.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":12160000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":5622000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":6.5,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":42.1,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":14.3,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":43.6,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":4446000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":90,"unit":"%"},"industry and services:":{"quantity":10,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":"NA%","Population below poverty line":{"quantity":60,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":2.1,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":38.2,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":46.8,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":20,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":1169000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":1366000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":6.4,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":11.25,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":"NA% (31 December 2010)","Stock of narrow money":{"usd":602300000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":1243000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":600400000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Agriculture - products":"coffee, tea, pyrethrum (insecticide made from chrysanthemums), bananas, beans, sorghum, potatoes; livestock","Industries":"cement, agricultural products, small-scale beverages, soap, furniture, shoes, plastic goods, textiles, cigarettes","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":7.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":120000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":231600000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":10000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":130000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":6000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":5623,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":56630000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-489 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":226000000},"Exports - commodities":"coffee, tea, hides, tin ore","Exports - partners":"Kenya 33.88%, Democratic Republic of the Congo 13.56%, Thailand 6.22%, China 5.49%, US 5.47%, Swaziland 5.43%, Belgium 5.19% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":1046999999.9999999},"Imports - commodities":"foodstuffs, machinery and equipment, steel, petroleum products, cement and construction material","Imports - partners":"Kenya 16.53%, Uganda 14.92%, China 7.92%, UAE 6.89%, Belgium 5.54%, Germany 5.19%, Tanzania 4.81%, Sweden 4% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":816000000},"Debt - external":"$NA","Exchange rates":"Rwandan francs (RWF) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"sa","name":"Saudi Arabia","region":"Middle East","background":"Saudi Arabia is the birthplace of Islam and home to Islam's two holiest shrines in Mecca and Medina. The king's official title is the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. The modern Saudi state was founded in 1932 by ABD AL-AZIZ bin Abd al-Rahman Al SAUD (Ibn Saud) after a 30-year campaign to unify most of the Arabian Peninsula. A male descendent of Ibn Saud, his son ABDALLAH bin Abd al-Aziz, rules the country today as required by the country's 1992 Basic Law. Following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, Saudi Arabia accepted the Kuwaiti royal family and 400,000 refugees while allowing Western and Arab troops to deploy on its soil for the liberation of Kuwait the following year. The continuing presence of foreign troops on Saudi soil after the liberation of Kuwait became a source of tension between the royal family and the public until all operational US troops left the country in 2003. Major terrorist attacks in May and November 2003 spurred a strong on-going campaign against domestic terrorism and extremism. King ABDALLAH has continued the cautious reform program begun when he was crown prince. To promote increased political participation, the government held elections nationwide from February through April 2005 for half the members of 179 municipal councils. In December 2005, King ABDALLAH completed the process by appointing the remaining members of the advisory municipal councils. The king instituted an Inter-Faith Dialogue initiative in 2008 to encourage religious tolerance on a global level; in February 2009, he reshuffled the cabinet, which led to more moderates holding ministerial and judicial positions, and appointed the first female to the cabinet. The country remains a leading producer of oil and natural gas and holds more than 20% of the world's proven oil reserves. The government continues to pursue economic reform and diversification, particularly since Saudi Arabia's accession to the WTO in December 2005, and promotes foreign investment in the kingdom. A burgeoning population, aquifer depletion, and an economy largely dependent on petroleum output and prices are all ongoing governmental concerns. The 2010-11 uprising across Middle Eastern and North African countries sparked modest incidents in Saudi cities, predominantly by Shia demonstrators calling for the release of detainees and the withdrawal from Bahrain of the Gulf Cooperation Council's Peninsula Shield Force. Other relatively minor, non-Shia demonstrations focused on labor, prisoner, and infrastructure complaints. Protests in general were met by a strong police presence, with some arrests, but not the bloodshed seen in protests elsewhere in the region. King ABDALLAH in February and March 2011 announced a series of benefits to Saudi citizens including funds to build affordable housing, salary increases for government workers, and unemployment benefits. The King also announced that Riyadh would begin preparations for a second round of municipal elections in September 2011.","geo":{"Location":"Middle East, bordering the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea, north of Yemen","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":25,"min":0},"E":{"deg":45,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total:":{"quantity":2149,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world:":"","land:":{"quantity":2149,"unit":"sq km"},"water:":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly more than one-fifth the size of the US","Land boundaries":{"total:":{"quantity":4431,"unit":"km"},"border countries:":"Iraq 814 km, Jordan 744 km, Kuwait 222 km, Oman 676 km, Qatar 60 km, UAE 457 km, Yemen 1,458 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":2640,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea:":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone:":{"quantity":18,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf:":"not specified"},"Climate":"harsh, dry desert with great temperature extremes","Terrain":"mostly uninhabited, sandy desert","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point:":"Persian Gulf 0 m","highest point:":"Jabal Sawda' 3,133 m"},"Natural resources":"petroleum, natural gas, iron ore, gold, copper","Land use":{"arable land:":{"quantity":1.67,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops:":{"quantity":0.09,"unit":"%"},"other:":{"quantity":98.24,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":17310,"unit":"sq km"},"Total renewable water resources":{"quantity":2.4,"unit":"cu km"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total:":{"quantity":17.32,"unit":"cu km/yr"},"per capita:":{"quantity":705,"unit":"cu m/yr"}},"Natural hazards":{"Natural hazards":"frequent sand and dust storms","volcanism:":"Despite Saudi Arabia's many volcanic formations, there has been little activity in the past few centuries;

Saudi Arabia is encouraging the growth of the private sector in order to diversify its economy and to employ more Saudi nationals. Diversification efforts are focusing on power generation, telecommunications, natural gas exploration, and petrochemical sectors. Almost 6 million foreign workers play an important role in the Saudi economy, particularly in the oil and service sectors, while Riyadh is struggling to reduce unemployment among its own nationals. Saudi officials are particularly focused on employing its large youth population, which generally lacks the education and technical skills the private sector needs. Riyadh has substantially boosted spending on job training and education, most recently with the opening of the King Abdallah University of Science and Technology - Saudi Arabia's first co-educational university. As part of its effort to attract foreign investment, Saudi Arabia acceded to the WTO in December 2005 after many years of negotiations.

Growth has been led by the tourist sector, which employs about 30% of the labor force and provides more than 70% of hard currency earnings, and by tuna fishing. In recent years, the government has encouraged foreign investment to upgrade hotels and other services. At the same time, the government has moved to reduce the dependence on tourism by promoting the development of farming, fishing, and small-scale manufacturing. GDP grew about 7-8% per year in 2006-07, driven by tourism and a boom in tourism-related construction. The Seychelles rupee was allowed to depreciate in 2006 after being overvalued for years and fell by 10% in the first 9 months of 2007. Despite these actions, the Seychelles economy has struggled to maintain its gains and in 2008 suffered from food and oil price shocks, a foreign exchange shortage, high inflation, large financing gaps, and the global recession. In July 2008 the government defaulted on a Euro amortizing note worth roughly US$80 million, leading to a downgrading of Seychelles credit rating, but in October 2010 the EU approved a $2.9 million grant as part of a larger four-year program for Seychelles. In response to Seychelles successful implementation of tighter monetary and fiscal policies, the IMF upgraded Seychelles to a three-year extended fund facility (EFF) of $31 million in December 2009. In 2008, GDP fell more than 1% due to declining tourism, but the economy recovered in 2009-10 with a notable increase in tourist numbers for 2010.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":2053000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":936000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":6.2,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":2.9,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":30.8,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":66.2,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":39560,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":23,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":74,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":2,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":"NA%","highest 10%:":"NA%"},"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":36.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":316500000},"expenditures:":{"usd":310300000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":58.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":"-2.2% (2010 est.)","Central bank discount rate":"NA% (31 December 2009)","Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":15.35,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":274200000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":415000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":678500000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Agriculture - products":"coconuts, cinnamon, vanilla, sweet potatoes, cassava (tapioca), copra, bananas; poultry; tuna","Industries":"fishing, tourism, processing of coconuts and vanilla, coir (coconut fiber) rope, boat building, printing, furniture; beverages","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":2,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":250000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":232500000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":7000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":7653,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-351 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":464000000},"Exports - commodities":"canned tuna, frozen fish, cinnamon bark, copra, petroleum products (reexports)","Exports - partners":"UK 24.84%, France 18.53%, Italy 9.45%, Mauritius 9.03%, Japan 6.98%, Spain 4.92% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":831000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery and equipment, foodstuffs, petroleum products, chemicals, other manufactured goods","Imports - partners":"Saudi Arabia 16.44%, India 8.33%, Spain 7.49%, South Africa 6.72%, France 6.39%, Brazil 6.07%, Singapore 5.07% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":193000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":1374000000},"Exchange rates":"Seychelles rupees (SCR) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"sf","name":"South Africa","region":"Africa","background":"Dutch traders landed at the southern tip of modern day South Africa in 1652 and established a stopover point on the spice route between the Netherlands and the Far East, founding the city of Cape Town. After the British seized the Cape of Good Hope area in 1806, many of the Dutch settlers (the Boers) trekked north to found their own republics. The discovery of diamonds (1867) and gold (1886) spurred wealth and immigration and intensified the subjugation of the native inhabitants. The Boers resisted British encroachments but were defeated in the Boer War (1899-1902); however, the British and the Afrikaners, as the Boers became known, ruled together beginning in 1910 under the Union of South Africa, which became a republic in 1961 after a whites-only referendum. In 1948, the National Party was voted into power and instituted a policy of apartheid - the separate development of the races - which favored the white minority at the expense of the black majority. The African National Congress (ANC) led the opposition to apartheid and many top ANC leaders, such as Nelson MANDELA, spent decades in South Africa's prisons. Internal protests and insurgency, as well as boycotts by some Western nations and institutions, led to the regime's eventual willingness to negotiate a peaceful transition to majority rule. The first multi-racial elections in 1994 brought an end to apartheid and ushered in majority rule under an ANC-led government. South Africa since then has struggled to address apartheid-era imbalances in decent housing, education, and health care. ANC infighting, which has grown in recent years, came to a head in September 2008 when President Thabo MBEKI resigned, and Kgalema MOTLANTHE, the party's General-Secretary, succeeded him as interim president. Jacob ZUMA became president after the ANC won general elections in April 2009. In January 2011, South Africa assumed a nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council for the 2011-12 term.","geo":{"Location":"Southern Africa, at the southern tip of the continent of Africa","Geographic coordinates":{"S":{"deg":29,"min":0},"E":{"deg":24,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total:":{"quantity":1219,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world:":"","land:":{"quantity":1214,"unit":"sq km"},"water:":{"quantity":4620,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly less than twice the size of Texas","Land boundaries":{"total:":{"quantity":4862,"unit":"km"},"border countries:":"Botswana 1,840 km, Lesotho 909 km, Mozambique 491 km, Namibia 967 km, Swaziland 430 km, Zimbabwe 225 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":2798,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea:":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone:":{"quantity":24,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone:":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf:":"200 nm or to edge of the continental margin"},"Climate":"mostly semiarid;

At the end of 2007, South Africa began to experience an electricity crisis. State power supplier Eskom encountered problems with aged plants, necessitating \"load-shedding\" cuts to residents and businesses in the major cities. Growth was robust from 2004 to 2007 as South Africa reaped the benefits of macroeconomic stability and a global commodities boom, but began to slow in the second half of 2007 due to the electricity crisis and the subsequent global financial crisis' impact on commodity prices and demand. GDP fell nearly 2% in 2009. Unemployment remains high and outdated infrastructure has constrained growth. Daunting economic problems remain from the apartheid era - especially poverty, lack of economic empowerment among the disadvantaged groups, and a shortage of public transportation. South Africa's former economic policy was fiscally conservative, focusing on controlling inflation, and attaining a budget surplus. The current government largely follows the same prudent policies, but must contend with the impact of the global crisis and is facing growing pressure from special interest groups to use state-owned enterprises to deliver basic services to low-income areas and to increase job growth. More than a quarter of South Africa's population currently receives social grants.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":524000000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":357300000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":2.8,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":31.2,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":65.8,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":"17.32 million economically active (2010 est.)","Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":9,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":26,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":65,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":23.3,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":50,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":1.3,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":44.7,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":65,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":19.9,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":103100000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":126200000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":33.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":4.5,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":7,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":11.71,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":65870000000.00001},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":256200000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":328300000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":704800000000},"Agriculture - products":"corn, wheat, sugarcane, fruits, vegetables; beef, poultry, mutton, wool, dairy products","Industries":"mining (world's largest producer of platinum, gold, chromium), automobile assembly, metalworking, machinery, textiles, iron and steel, chemicals, fertilizer, foodstuffs, commercial ship repair","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":240300000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":215100000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":14160000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":10570000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":191000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":579000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":128500,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":490500,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":15000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":3250000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":6450000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":3200000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":27160000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-16.51 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":76860000000},"Exports - commodities":"gold, diamonds, platinum, other metals and minerals, machinery and equipment","Exports - partners":"China 10.34%, US 9.19%, Japan 7.59%, Germany 7.01%, UK 5.54%, Switzerland 4.72% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":77040000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery and equipment, chemicals, petroleum products, scientific instruments, foodstuffs","Imports - partners":"China 17.21%, Germany 11.24%, US 7.38%, Saudi Arabia 4.87%, Japan 4.67%, Iran 3.95% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":45520000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":80520000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":83080000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":53380000000},"Exchange rates":"rand (ZAR) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"sg","name":"Senegal","region":"Africa","background":"The French colonies of Senegal and the French Sudan were merged in 1959 and granted their independence as the Mali Federation in 1960.

The country's key export industries are phosphate mining, fertilizer production, and commercial fishing. The country is also working on iron ore and oil exploration projects. In January 1994, Senegal undertook a bold and ambitious economic reform program with the support of the international donor community. Government price controls and subsidies have been steadily dismantled. After seeing its economy contract by 2.1% in 1993, Senegal made an important turnaround, thanks to the reform program, with real growth in GDP averaging over 5% annually during 1995-2007. Annual inflation had been pushed down to the single digits. The country was adversely affected by the global economic downturn in 2009 and GDP growth fell below 2%. As a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), Senegal is working toward greater regional integration with a unified external tariff and a more stable monetary policy. High unemployment, however, continues to prompt illegal migrants to flee Senegal in search of better job opportunities in Europe. Under the IMF's Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) debt relief program, Senegal benefited from eradication of two-thirds of its bilateral, multilateral, and private-sector debt. In 2007, Senegal and the IMF agreed to a new, non-disbursing, Policy Support Initiative program which was completed in 2010. Senegal received its first disbursement from the $540 million Millennium Challenge Account compact it signed in September 2009 for infrastructure and agriculture development. In 2010, the Senegalese people protested against frequent power cuts. The government pledged to expand capacity by 2012 and to promote renewable energy but until Senegal has more capacity, more protests are likely and economic activity will be hindered.

In December 2007, Slovenia was invited to begin the accession process for joining the OECD. Despite its economic success, foreign direct investment (FDI) in Slovenia has lagged behind the region average, and taxes remain relatively high. Furthermore, the labor market is often seen as inflexible, and legacy industries are losing sales to more competitive firms in China, India, and elsewhere.

The Spanish finally relinquished the island of Saint Martin to the French and Dutch, who divided it amongst themselves in 1648.

While it possesses substantial mineral, agricultural, and fishery resources, its physical and social infrastructure has yet to recover from the civil war, and serious social disorders continue to hamper economic development. Nearly half of the working-age population engages in subsistence agriculture. Manufacturing consists mainly of the processing of raw materials and of light manufacturing for the domestic market. Alluvial diamond mining remains the major source of hard currency earnings, accounting for nearly half of Sierra Leone's exports. The fate of the economy depends upon the maintenance of domestic peace and the continued receipt of substantial aid from abroad, which is essential to offset the severe trade imbalance and supplement government revenues. The IMF has completed a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility program that helped stabilize economic growth and reduce inflation and in 2010 approved a new program worth $45 million over three years. Political stability has led to a revival of economic activity such as the rehabilitation of bauxite and rutile mining, which are set to benefit from planned tax incentives. A number of offshore oil discoveries were announced in 2009 and 2010. The development on these reserves, which could be significant, is still several years away.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":4720000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":1905000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":5,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":49,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":31,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":21,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":2207000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":"NA%","industry:":"NA%","services:":"NA%"},"Unemployment rate":"NA%","Population below poverty line":{"quantity":70.2,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":2.6,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":33.6,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":62.9,"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":96000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":351000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":11.7,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":"NA%","Commercial bank prime lending rate":"NA% (31 December 2010)","Stock of narrow money":{"usd":209400000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":437000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":178400000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Agriculture - products":"rice, coffee, cocoa, palm kernels, palm oil, peanuts; poultry, cattle, sheep, pigs; fish","Industries":"diamond mining; small-scale manufacturing (beverages, textiles, cigarettes, footwear); petroleum refining, small commercial ship repair","Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Electricity - production":{"quantity":80000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":74400000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":28.98,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":9000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":502.4,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":8316,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-63 million (2007 est.)","Exports":{"usd":216000000},"Exports - commodities":"diamonds, rutile, cocoa, coffee, fish","Exports - partners":"Belgium 26.56%, US 11.87%, Netherlands 7.91%, UK 7.4%, India 6.67%, Cote d'Ivoire 6.13%, Greece 4.05% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":560000000},"Imports - commodities":"foodstuffs, machinery and equipment, fuels and lubricants, chemicals","Imports - partners":"South Africa 14.61%, China 7.58%, US 5.87%, Cote d'Ivoire 5.65%, India 5.19%, Malaysia 5.19%, France 5.08%, UK 4.48%, Netherlands 4.06% (2009)","Debt - external":{"usd":1610000000},"Exchange rates":"leones (SLL) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"sm","name":"San Marino","region":"Europe","background":"The third smallest state in Europe (after the Holy See and Monaco), San Marino also claims to be the world's oldest republic.

The per capita level of output and standard of living are comparable to those of the most prosperous regions of Italy, which supplies much of its food. San Marino boasts the world's longest life expectancy for men with 80 years. The economy benefits from foreign investment due to its relatively low corporate taxes and low taxes on interest earnings. San Marino has recently faced increased international pressure to improve cooperation with foreign tax authorities and transparency within its own banking sector, which generates about one-fifth of the country's tax revenues. Italy's implementation in October 2009 of a tax amnesty to repatriate untaxed funds held abroad has resulted in financial outflows from San Marino to Italy worth more than $4.5 billion. Such outflows, combined with a money-laundering scandal at San Marino's largest financial institution and the recent global economic downturn, have contributed to a deep recession and growing budget deficit. Industrial production declined sharply in 2010, especially in the textile sector. However, San Marino has little national debt, and an unemployment rate less than half the size of Italy's. The San Marino government has adopted measures to counter the downturn, including subsidized credit to businesses. San Marino also continues to work towards harmonizing its fiscal laws with EU members and international standards. In September 2009, the OECD removed San Marino from its list of tax havens that have yet to fully implement global tax standards, and in 2010 San Marino signed Tax Information Exchange Agreements with most major countries. The future of the country's economy will be heavily influenced by the signing of a financial information exchange agreement with Italy, which many Italian investors see as fundamental for their business operations with San Marino.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":1137000000},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":1535000000},"GDP - real growth rate":"-13% (2009 est.)","GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":0.1,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":39.2,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":60.7,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":22950,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":0.2,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":36.3,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":63.5,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":3.8,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":"NA%","highest 10%:":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":882100000},"expenditures:":{"usd":940400000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":2.8,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":5.39,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":"$NA (31 December 2008)","Stock of broad money":"$NA (31 December 2008)","Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":8822000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Agriculture - products":"wheat, grapes, corn, olives; cattle, pigs, horses, beef, cheese, hides","Industries":"tourism, banking, textiles, electronics, ceramics, cement, wine","Industrial production growth rate":"-4.9% (2009)","Exports":{"usd":2436000000},"Exports - commodities":"building stone, lime, wood, chestnuts, wheat, wine, baked goods, hides, ceramics","Imports":{"usd":2165000000},"Imports - commodities":"wide variety of consumer manufactures, food","Debt - external":"$NA","Exchange rates":"euros (EUR) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"sn","name":"Singapore","region":"East & Southeast Asia","background":"Singapore was founded as a British trading colony in 1819.

It enjoys a remarkably open and corruption-free environment, stable prices, and a per capita GDP higher than that of most developed countries. The economy depends heavily on exports, particularly in consumer electronics, information technology products, pharmaceuticals, and on a growing financial services sector. Real GDP growth averaged 7.1% between 2004 and 2007. The economy contracted 1.3% in 2009 as a result of the global financial crisis, but rebounded nearly 14.7% in 2010, on the strength of renewed exports. Over the longer term, the government hopes to establish a new growth path that focuses on raising productivity, which has sunk to 1% growth per year in the last decade. Singapore has attracted major investments in pharmaceuticals and medical technology production and will continue efforts to establish Singapore as Southeast Asia's financial and high-tech hub.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":291900000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":222700000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":14.5,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":0,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":27.2,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":72.8,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":3075000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":0.1,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":30.2,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":69.7,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":2.1,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":4.4,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":23.2,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":47.8,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":27.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":29870000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":34009999999.999996}},"Public debt":{"Public debt":{"quantity":102.4,"unit":"% of GDP"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":2.8,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":5.38,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":82130000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":294400000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":199800000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":620500000000},"Agriculture - products":"orchids, vegetables; poultry, eggs; fish, ornamental fish","Industries":"electronics, chemicals, financial services, oil drilling equipment, petroleum refining, rubber processing and rubber products, processed food and beverages, ship repair, offshore platform construction, life sciences, entrepot trade","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":25,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":39210000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":37110000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":10910,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":927000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":1374000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":1195000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":8340999999.999999,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":8340999999.999999,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":44080000000},"Exports":{"usd":351200000000},"Exports - commodities":"machinery and equipment (including electronics), consumer goods, pharmaceuticals and other chemicals, mineral fuels","Exports - partners":"Hong Kong 11.6%, Malaysia 11.5%, US 11.2%, Indonesia 9.7%, China 9.7%, Japan 4.6%, Hong Kong 11.6% (2009 est.)","Imports":{"usd":310400000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery and equipment, mineral fuels, chemicals, foodstuffs, consumer goods","Imports - partners":"US 14.7%, Malaysia 11.6%, China 10.5%, Japan 7.6%, Indonesia 5.8%, South Korea 5.7% (2009 est.)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":225800000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":21660000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":274600000000.00003},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":172100000000},"Exchange rates":"Singapore dollars (SGD) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"so","name":"Somalia","region":"Africa","background":"Britain withdrew from British Somaliland in 1960 to allow its protectorate to join with Italian Somaliland and form the new nation of Somalia. In 1969, a coup headed by Mohamed SIAD Barre ushered in an authoritarian socialist rule characterized by the persecution, jailing and torture of political opponents and dissidents. After the regime's collapse early in 1991, Somalia descended into turmoil, factional fighting, and anarchy. In May 1991, northern clans declared an independent Republic of Somaliland that now includes the administrative regions of Awdal, Woqooyi Galbeed, Togdheer, Sanaag, and Sool. Although not recognized by any government, this entity has maintained a stable existence and continues efforts to establish a constitutional democracy, including holding municipal, parliamentary, and presidential elections. The regions of Bari, Nugaal, and northern Mudug comprise a neighboring semi-autonomous state of Puntland, which has been self-governing since 1998 but does not aim at independence; it has also made strides toward reconstructing a legitimate, representative government but has suffered some civil strife. Puntland disputes its border with Somaliland as it also claims portions of eastern Sool and Sanaag. Beginning in 1993, a two-year UN humanitarian effort (primarily in the south) was able to alleviate famine conditions, but when the UN withdrew in 1995, having suffered significant casualties, order still had not been restored. In 2000, the Somalia National Peace Conference (SNPC) held in Djibouti resulted in the formation of an interim government, known as the Transitional National Government (TNG). When the TNG failed to establish adequate security or governing institutions, the Government of Kenya, under the auspices of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), led a subsequent peace process that concluded in October 2004 with the election of Abdullahi YUSUF Ahmed as President of a second interim government, known as the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) of the Somali Republic. The TFG included a 275-member parliamentary body, known as the Transitional Federal Parliament (TFP). President YUSUF resigned late in 2008 while United Nations-sponsored talks between the TFG and the opposition Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia (ARS) were underway in Djibouti. In January 2009, following the creation of a TFG-ARS unity government, Ethiopian military forces, which had entered Somalia in December 2006 to support the TFG in the face of advances by the opposition Islamic Courts Union (ICU), withdrew from the country. The TFP was increased to 550 seats with the addition of 200 ARS and 75 civil society members of parliament. The expanded parliament elected Sheikh SHARIF Sheikh Ahmed, the former CIC and ARS chairman as president on 31 January 2009, in Djibouti. Subsequently, President SHARIF appointed Omar Abdirashid ali SHARMARKE, son of a former president of Somalia, as prime minister on 13 February 2009. SHARMARKE resigned in September 2010 and was replaced by Mohamed Abdullahi MOHAMED, aka Farmajo, a dual US-Somali citizen who lived in the United States from 1985 until his return to Somalia in October 2010. The creation of the TFG was based on the Transitional Federal Charter (TFC), which outlines a five-year mandate leading to the establishment of a new Somali constitution and a transition to a representative government following national elections. However, in January 2009 the TFP amended the TFC to extend TFG's mandate until 2011.","geo":{"Location":"Eastern Africa, bordering the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean, east of Ethiopia","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":10,"min":0},"E":{"deg":49,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total:":{"quantity":637657,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world:":"","land:":{"quantity":627337,"unit":"sq km"},"water:":{"quantity":10320,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than Texas","Land boundaries":{"total:":{"quantity":2340,"unit":"km"},"border countries:":"Djibouti 58 km, Ethiopia 1,600 km, Kenya 682 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":3025,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea:":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"}},"Climate":"principally desert;

Nomads and semi-pastoralists, who are dependent upon livestock for their livelihood, make up a large portion of the population. Livestock, hides, fish, charcoal, and bananas are Somalia's principal exports, while sugar, sorghum, corn, qat, and machined goods are the principal imports. Somalia's small industrial sector, based on the processing of agricultural products, has largely been looted and the machinery sold as scrap metal. Somalia's service sector also has grown. Telecommunication firms provide wireless services in most major cities and offer the lowest international call rates on the continent. In the absence of a formal banking sector, money transfer/remittance services have sprouted throughout the country, handling up to $1.6 billion in remittances annually. Mogadishu's main market offers a variety of goods from food to the newest electronic gadgets. Hotels continue to operate and are supported with private-security militias. Due to armed attacks on and threats to humanitarian aid workers, the World Food Programme partially suspended its operations in southern Somalia in early January 2010 pending improvement in the security situation.

However, after almost 15 years of above average GDP growth, the Spanish economy began to slow in late 2007 and entered into a recession in the second quarter of 2008. GDP contracted by 3.7% in 2009, ending a 16-year growth trend, and by another 0.2% in 2010, making Spain the last major economy to emerge from the global recession. The reversal in Spain's economic growth reflected a significant decline in construction amid an oversupply of housing and falling consumer spending, while exports actually have begun to grow. Government efforts to boost the economy through stimulus spending, extended unemployment benefits, and loan guarantees did not prevent a sharp rise in the unemployment rate, which rose from a low of about 8% in 2007 to 20% in 2010. The government budget deficit worsened from 3.8% of GDP in 2008 to about 9.7% of GDP in 2010, more than three times the euro-zone limit. Spain's large budget deficit and poor economic growth prospects have made it vulnerable to financial contagion from other highly-indebted euro zone members despite the government's efforts to cut spending, privatize industries, and boost competitiveness through labor market reforms. Spanish banks' high exposure to the collapsed domestic construction and real estate market also poses a continued risk for the sector. The government oversaw a restructuring of the savings bank sector in 2010, and provided some $15 billion in capital to various institutions. Investors remain concerned that Madrid may need to bail out more troubled banks. The Bank of Spain, however, is seeking to boost confidence in the financial sector by pressuring banks to come clean about their losses and consolidate into stronger groups.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":1369000000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":1410000000000},"GDP - real growth rate":"-0.1% (2010 est.)","GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":2.9,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":25.5,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":71.6,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":22960000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":4.2,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":24,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":71.7,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":20,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":19.8,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":2.6,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":26.6,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":32,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":22.9,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":515799999999.99994},"expenditures:":{"usd":648600000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":63.4,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1.3,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":1.75,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":10.72,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":849200000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":2264000000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":3683000000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":1297000000000},"Agriculture - products":"grain, vegetables, olives, wine grapes, sugar beets, citrus; beef, pork, poultry, dairy products; fish","Industries":"textiles and apparel (including footwear), food and beverages, metals and metal manufactures, chemicals, shipbuilding, automobiles, machine tools, tourism, clay and refractory products, footwear, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment","Industrial production growth rate":"-2% (2010 est.)","Electricity - production":{"quantity":300500000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":276100000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":16920000000.000002,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":5880000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":27230,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":1482000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":218600,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":1716000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":150000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":13000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":33880000000.000004,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":975000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":34670000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":2548000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-66.74 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":268300000000},"Exports - commodities":"machinery, motor vehicles; foodstuffs, pharmaceuticals, medicines, other consumer goods","Exports - partners":"France 19.27%, Germany 11.11%, Portugal 9.21%, Italy 8.24%, UK 6.18% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":324600000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery and equipment, fuels, chemicals, semifinished goods, foodstuffs, consumer goods, measuring and medical control instruments","Imports - partners":"Germany 15.02%, France 12.82%, Italy 7.17%, China 5.8%, Netherlands 5.22%, UK 4.7% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":"$NA (31 December 2010 est.)","Debt - external":{"usd":2166000000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":668500000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":641000000000},"Exchange rates":"euros (EUR) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"st","name":"Saint Lucia","region":"Central America and Caribbean","background":"The island, with its fine natural harbor at Castries, was contested between England and France throughout the 17th and early 18th centuries (changing possession 14 times); it was finally ceded to the UK in 1814.

Although crops such as bananas, mangos, and avocados continue to be grown for export, tourism provides Saint Lucia's main source of income and the industry is the island's biggest employer. Tourism is the main source of foreign exchange, although tourism sector revenues declined with the global economic downturn as US and European travel dropped in 2009. The manufacturing sector is the most diverse in the Eastern Caribbean area, and the government is trying to revitalize the banana industry, although recent hurricanes have caused exports to contract. Saint Lucia is vulnerable to a variety of external shocks including volatile tourism receipts, natural disasters, and dependence on foreign oil. The public debt-to-GDP ratio is about 77% and high debt servicing obligations constrain the KING administration's ability to respond to adverse external shocks. Economic fundamentals remain solid, even though unemployment needs to be reduced.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":1798000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":985000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":0.8,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":5,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":15,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":80,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":79700,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":21.7,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":24.7,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":53.6,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":20,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":"NA%","highest 10%:":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":320900000},"expenditures:":{"usd":393300000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1.9,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":6.5,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":10.58,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":244300000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":1094000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":1378000000},"Agriculture - products":"bananas, coconuts, vegetables, citrus, root crops, cocoa","Industries":"clothing, assembly of electronic components, beverages, corrugated cardboard boxes, tourism; lime processing, coconut processing","Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Electricity - production":{"quantity":325000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":302200000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":3000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":2747,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-199 million (2007 est.)","Exports":{"usd":288000000},"Exports - commodities":"bananas 41%, clothing, cocoa, vegetables, fruits, coconut oil","Exports - partners":"Spain 29.41%, UK 15.28%, South Korea 10.54%, US 9.75%, India 9.52% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":791000000},"Imports - commodities":"food 23%, manufactured goods 21%, machinery and transportation equipment 19%, chemicals, fuels","Imports - partners":"Brazil 83.44%, US 4.67%, Trinidad and Tobago 4.56% (2009)","Debt - external":{"usd":257000000},"Exchange rates":"East Caribbean dollars (XCD) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"su","name":"Sudan","region":"Africa","background":"Military regimes favoring Islamic-oriented governments have dominated national politics since independence from the UK in 1956. Sudan was embroiled in two prolonged civil wars during most of the remainder of the 20th century. These conflicts were rooted in northern economic, political, and social domination of largely non-Muslim, non-Arab southern Sudanese. The first civil war ended in 1972 but broke out again in 1983. The second war and famine-related effects resulted in more than four million people displaced and, according to rebel estimates, more than two million deaths over a period of two decades. Peace talks gained momentum in 2002-04 with the signing of several accords. The final North/South Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), signed in January 2005, granted the southern rebels autonomy for six years followed by a referendum on independence for Southern Sudan. The referendum was held in January 2011 and indicated overwhelming support for independence. A separate conflict, which broke out in the western region of Darfur in 2003, has displaced nearly two million people and caused an estimated 200,000 to 400,000 deaths. The UN took command of the Darfur peacekeeping operation from the African Union in December 2007. Peacekeeping troops have struggled to stabilize the situation, which has become increasingly regional in scope and has brought instability to eastern Chad. Sudan also has faced large refugee influxes from neighboring countries primarily Ethiopia and Chad. Armed conflict, poor transport infrastructure, and lack of government support have chronically obstructed the provision of humanitarian assistance to affected populations.","geo":{"Location":"Northern Africa, bordering the Red Sea, between Egypt and Eritrea","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":15,"min":0},"E":{"deg":30,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total:":{"quantity":2505,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world:":"","land:":{"quantity":2376000,"unit":"sq km"},"water:":{"quantity":129813,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly more than one-quarter the size of the US","Land boundaries":{"total:":{"quantity":7687,"unit":"km"},"border countries:":"Central African Republic 1,165 km, Chad 1,360 km, Democratic Republic of the Congo 628 km, Egypt 1,273 km, Eritrea 605 km, Ethiopia 1,606 km, Kenya 232 km, Libya 383 km, Uganda 435 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":853,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea:":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone:":{"quantity":18,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf:":"200 m depth or to the depth of exploitation"},"Climate":"tropical in south;

A new currency, the Sudanese Pound, was introduced in January 2007 at an initial exchange rate of $1.00 equals 2 Sudanese Pounds. Sudan began exporting crude oil in the last quarter of 1999 and the economy boomed on the back of increases in oil production, high oil prices, and significant inflows of foreign direct investment until the second half of 2008. The Darfur conflict, the aftermath of two decades of civil war in the south, the lack of basic infrastructure in large areas, and a reliance by much of the population on subsistence agriculture ensure much of the population will remain at or below the poverty line for years to come despite rapid rises in average per capita income. Sudan's real GDP expanded by 5.2% during 2010, an improvement over 2009's 4.2% growth but significantly below the more than 10% per year growth experienced prior to the global financial crisis in 2006 and 2007. While the oil sector continues to drive growth, services and utilities play an increasingly important role in the economy with agriculture production remaining important as it employs 80% of the work force and contributes a third of GDP. In the lead up to the referendum on southern secession, which took place in January 2011, Sudan saw its currency depreciate considerably on the black market with the Central Bank's official rate also losing value as the Sudanese people started to hoard foreign currency. The Central Bank of Sudan intervened heavily in the currency market to defend the value of the pound and the Sudanese government introduced a number of measures to restrain excess local demand for hard currency, but uncertainty about the secession has meant that foreign exchange remains in heavy demand.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":100000000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":68440000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":5.1,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":32.1,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":29,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":38.9,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":11920000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":80,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":7,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":13,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":18.7,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":40,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":"NA%","highest 10%:":"NA%"},"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":20.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":11060000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":13150000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":94.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":11.8,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":7713000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":13500000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":10150000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Agriculture - products":"cotton, groundnuts (peanuts), sorghum, millet, wheat, gum arabic, sugarcane, cassava (tapioca), mangos, papaya, bananas, sweet potatoes, sesame; sheep and other livestock","Industries":"oil, cotton ginning, textiles, cement, edible oils, sugar, soap distilling, shoes, petroleum refining, pharmaceuticals, armaments, automobile/light truck assembly","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":3.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":4341000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":3438000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":486700,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":84000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":303800,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":11400,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":6800000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":84950000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-2.595 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":9777000000},"Exports - commodities":"oil and petroleum products; cotton, sesame, livestock, groundnuts, gum arabic, sugar","Exports - partners":"China 58.29%, Japan 14.7%, Indonesia 8.83%, India 4.86% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":8483000000.000001},"Imports - commodities":"foodstuffs, manufactured goods, refinery and transport equipment, medicines and chemicals, textiles, wheat","Imports - partners":"China 21.87%, Saudi Arabia 7.22%, Egypt 6.1%, India 5.53%, UAE 5.3% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":2063000000.0000002},"Debt - external":{"usd":37980000000},"Exchange rates":"Sudanese pounds (SDG) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"sv","name":"Svalbard","region":"Europe","background":"First discovered by the Norwegians in the 12th century, the islands served as an international whaling base during the 17th and 18th centuries.

Agriculture accounts for little more than 1% of GDP and of employment. Until 2008, Sweden was in the midst of a sustained economic upswing, boosted by increased domestic demand and strong exports. This and robust finances offered the center-right government considerable scope to implement its reform program aimed at increasing employment, reducing welfare dependence, and streamlining the state's role in the economy. Despite strong finances and underlying fundamentals, the Swedish economy slid into recession in the third quarter of 2008 and growth continued downward in 2009 as deteriorating global conditions reduced export demand and consumption. Strong exports of commodities and a return to profitability by Sweden's banking sector drove the strong rebound in 2010.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":354700000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":455800000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":5.5,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":1.7,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":26.1,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":72.2,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":4930000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":1.1,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":28.2,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":70.7,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":8.3,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":3.6,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":22.2,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":23,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":18.1,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":230100000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":236600000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":40.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1.4,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":2,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":"NA%","Stock of narrow money":{"usd":225000000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":293200000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":640200000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":432300000000},"Agriculture - products":"barley, wheat, sugar beets; meat, milk","Industries":"iron and steel, precision equipment (bearings, radio and telephone parts, armaments), wood pulp and paper products, processed foods, motor vehicles","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":8,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":144000000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":134500000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":14710000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":12750000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":4833,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":328100,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":248500,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":589900,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":1229000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":1229000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":21680000000},"Exports":{"usd":162600000000},"Exports - commodities":"machinery 35%, motor vehicles, paper products, pulp and wood, iron and steel products, chemicals","Exports - partners":"Norway 10.61%, Germany 10.2%, UK 7.45%, Denmark 7.35%, Finland 6.44%, US 6.36%, France 5.05%, Netherlands 4.67% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":158600000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery, petroleum and petroleum products, chemicals, motor vehicles, iron and steel; foodstuffs, clothing","Imports - partners":"Germany 17.9%, Denmark 8.9%, Norway 8.7%, Netherlands 6.17%, UK 5.56%, Finland 5.14%, France 5.06%, China 4.79% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":"$NA (31 December 2010 est.)","Debt - external":{"usd":853300000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":321400000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":383900000000},"Exchange rates":"Swedish kronor (SEK) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"sx","name":"South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands","region":"South America","background":"The islands, which have large bird and seal populations, lie approximately 1,000 km east of the Falkland Islands and have been under British administration since 1908 - except for a brief period in 1982 when Argentina occupied them.

The French administered the area as Syria until granting it independence in 1946. The new country lacked political stability, however, and experienced a series of military coups during its first decades. Syria united with Egypt in February 1958 to form the United Arab Republic. In September 1961, the two entities separated, and the Syrian Arab Republic was reestablished. In November 1970, Hafiz al-ASAD, a member of the Socialist Ba'th Party and the minority Alawite sect, seized power in a bloodless coup and brought political stability to the country. In the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, Syria lost the Golan Heights to Israel. During the 1990s, Syria and Israel held occasional peace talks over its return. Following the death of President al-ASAD, his son, Bashar al-ASAD, was approved as president by popular referendum in July 2000. Syrian troops - stationed in Lebanon since 1976 in an ostensible peacekeeping role - were withdrawn in April 2005. During the July-August 2006 conflict between Israel and Hizballah, Syria placed its military forces on alert but did not intervene directly on behalf of its ally Hizballah. In May 2007 Bashar al-ASAD was elected to his second term as president. Influenced by major uprisings that began elsewhere in the region, antigovernment protests broke out in the southern province of Da'ra in March 2011 and spread to other Syrian cities. Protesters called for the repeal of the restrictive Emergency Law allowing arrests without charge, the legalization of political parties, and the removal of corrupt local officials. The government responded with a mix of force and concessions, including the repeal of the Emergency Law, but as of mid-April 2011 had not succeeded in quelling protests.","geo":{"Location":"Middle East, bordering the Mediterranean Sea, between Lebanon and Turkey","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":35,"min":0},"E":{"deg":38,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total:":{"quantity":185180,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world:":"","land:":{"quantity":183630,"unit":"sq km"},"water:":{"quantity":1550,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly larger than North Dakota","Land boundaries":{"total:":{"quantity":2253,"unit":"km"},"border countries:":"Iraq 605 km, Israel 76 km, Jordan 375 km, Lebanon 375 km, Turkey 822 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":193,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea:":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone:":{"quantity":24,"unit":"nm"}},"Climate":"mostly desert;

In addition, President ASAD signed legislative decrees to encourage corporate ownership reform, and to allow the Central Bank to issue Treasury bills and bonds for government debt. Nevertheless, the economy remains highly controlled by the government. Long-run economic constraints include declining oil production, high unemployment, rising budget deficits, and increasing pressure on water supplies caused by heavy use in agriculture, rapid population growth, industrial expansion, and water pollution.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":107400000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":59330000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":3.2,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":17.6,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":26.8,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":55.6,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":5527000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":17,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":16,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":67,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":8.3,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":11.9,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":"NA%","highest 10%:":"NA%"},"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":16.6,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":12530000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":15300000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":29.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":5.9,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":5,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":10.04,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":21600000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":161000000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":27140000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Agriculture - products":"wheat, barley, cotton, lentils, chickpeas, olives, sugar beets; beef, mutton, eggs, poultry, milk","Industries":"petroleum, textiles, food processing, beverages, tobacco, phosphate rock mining, cement, oil seeds crushing, car assembly","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":6,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":36500000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":27350000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":1400000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":400400,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":252000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":155000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":58710,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":2500000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":6040000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":6180000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":140000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":240700000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":649000000},"Exports":{"usd":12840000000},"Exports - commodities":"crude oil, minerals, petroleum products, fruits and vegetables, cotton fiber, textiles, clothing, meat and live animals, wheat","Exports - partners":"Iraq 30.22%, Lebanon 12.21%, Germany 8.89%, Egypt 6.8%, Saudi Arabia 5.04%, Italy 4.55% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":13570000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery and transport equipment, electric power machinery, food and livestock, metal and metal products, chemicals and chemical products, plastics, yarn, paper","Imports - partners":"Saudi Arabia 10.1%, China 9.95%, Turkey 6.97%, Egypt 6.44%, UAE 4.97%, Italy 4.93%, Russia 4.92%, Germany 4.38%, Lebanon 4.12% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":17960000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":7682000000},"Exchange rates":"Syrian pounds (SYP) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"sz","name":"Switzerland","region":"Europe","background":"The Swiss Confederation was founded in 1291 as a defensive alliance among three cantons.

Switzerland's economy benefits from a highly developed service sector, led by financial services, and a manufacturing industry that specializes in high-technology, knowledge-based production. The Swiss have brought their economic practices largely into conformity with the EU's, in order to enhance their international competitiveness, but some trade protectionism remains, particularly for its small agricultural sector. The global financial crisis and resulting economic downturn put Switzerland in a recession in 2009 as global export demand stalled. The Swiss National Bank during this period effectively implemented a zero-interest rate policy in a bid to boost the economy and prevent appreciation of the franc. Switzerland's economy grew by 2.7% in 2010, when Bern implemented a third fiscal stimulus program, but its prized banking sector has recently faced significant challenges. The country's largest banks suffered sizable losses in 2008-09, leading its largest bank to accept a government rescue deal in late 2008. Switzerland has also come under increasing pressure from individual neighboring countries, the EU, the US, and international institutions to reform its banking secrecy laws. Consequently, the government agreed to conform to OECD regulations on administrative assistance in tax matters, including tax evasion. The government has renegotiated its double taxation agreements with numerous countries, including the US, to incorporate the OECD standard, and it is working with Germany and the UK to resolve outstanding issues, particularly the possibility of imposing taxes on bank deposits held by foreigners. Parliament passed the first five double-taxation agreements, including that with the US, in March 2010. The agreement with the US awaits US Senate approval. In 2009, Swiss financial regulators ordered the country's largest bank to reveal at Washington's behest the names of US account-holders suspected of using the bank to commit tax fraud. These steps will have a lasting impact on Switzerland's long history of bank secrecy.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":324500000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":523799999999.99994},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":2.6,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":1.3,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":27.5,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":71.2,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":4620000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":3.4,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":23.4,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":73.2,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":3.9,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":6.9,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":7.5,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":19,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":33.7,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":19.9,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":188100000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":192700000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":38.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":0.7,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":0.04,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":0.54,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":384200000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":834600000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":879700000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":1071000000000},"Agriculture - products":"grains, fruits, vegetables; meat, eggs","Industries":"machinery, chemicals, watches, textiles, precision instruments, tourism, banking, and insurance","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":2.4,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":66500000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":57500000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":54200000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":52000000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":3488,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":280000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":10680,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":263600,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":3042000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":3042000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":49350000000},"Exports":{"usd":232600000000},"Exports - commodities":"machinery, chemicals, metals, watches, agricultural products","Exports - partners":"Germany 20.98%, US 9.09%, France 8.62%, Italy 8.08%, Austria 5.38% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":226300000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery, chemicals, vehicles, metals; agricultural products, textiles","Imports - partners":"Germany 27.19%, Italy 10.42%, US 9.61%, France 7.69%, Netherlands 4.35% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":236600000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":1200000000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":514000000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":814600000000},"Exchange rates":"Swiss francs (CHF) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"tb","name":"Saint Barthelemy","region":"Central America and Caribbean","background":"Discovered in 1493 by Christopher COLUMBUS who named it for his brother Bartolomeo, Saint Barthelemy was first settled by the French in 1648.

Economic growth between 2000 and 2007 averaged slightly over 8%, significantly above the regional average of about 3.7% for that same period; however, GDP has slowed down since then and contracted about 3.5% in 2009, before rising more than 2% in 2010. Growth has been fueled by investments in liquefied natural gas (LNG), petrochemicals, and steel. Additional petrochemical, aluminum, and plastics projects are in various stages of planning. Trinidad and Tobago is the leading Caribbean producer of oil and gas, and its economy is heavily dependent upon these resources but it also supplies manufactured goods, notably food products and beverages, as well as cement to the Caribbean region. Oil and gas account for about 40% of GDP and 80% of exports, but only 5% of employment. The country is also a regional financial center, and tourism is a growing sector, although it is not as important domestically as it is to many other Caribbean islands. The economy benefits from a growing trade surplus. The previous MANNING administration benefited from fiscal surpluses fueled by the dynamic export sector; however, declines in oil and gas prices have reduced government revenues which will challenge the new government's commitment to maintaining high levels of public investment.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":26100000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":20590000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":0,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":0.5,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":59.4,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":40.1,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":631000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":3.8,"unit":"%"},"manufacturing, mining, and quarrying:":{"quantity":12.8,"unit":"%"},"construction and utilities:":{"quantity":20.4,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":62.9,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":6.4,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":17,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":"NA%","highest 10%:":"NA%"},"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":11.6,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":6614000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":7240000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":26.4,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":11.3,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":7.25,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":11.94,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":3734000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":12470000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":2924000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":11150000000},"Agriculture - products":"cocoa, rice, citrus, coffee, vegetables; poultry","Industries":"petroleum and petroleum products, liquefied natural gas (LNG), methanol, ammonia, urea, steel products, beverages, food processing, cement, cotton textiles","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":2.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":7202000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":7034000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":151600,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":43000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":248300,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":92480,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":728300000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":39300000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":21940000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":17360000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":436100000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":3363000000},"Exports":{"usd":12060000000},"Exports - commodities":"petroleum and petroleum products, liquefied natural gas (LNG), methanol, ammonia, urea, steel products, beverages, cereal and cereal products, sugar, cocoa, coffee, citrus fruit, vegetables, flowers","Exports - partners":"US 38.53%, Jamaica 8.86%, Spain 6.88%, Mexico 6.23% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":8234000000},"Imports - commodities":"mineral fuels, lubricants, machinery, transportation equipment, manufactured goods, food, chemicals, live animals","Imports - partners":"US 30.87%, Colombia 7.1%, Venezuela 7.01%, Russia 6.64%, Brazil 5.53%, China 4.19% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":9659000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":4303000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":102000000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":3829000000},"Exchange rates":"Trinidad and Tobago dollars (TTD) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"th","name":"Thailand","region":"East & Southeast Asia","background":"A unified Thai kingdom was established in the mid-14th century. Known as Siam until 1939, Thailand is the only Southeast Asian country never to have been taken over by a European power. A bloodless revolution in 1932 led to a constitutional monarchy. In alliance with Japan during World War II, Thailand became a US treaty ally in 1954 after sending troops to Korea and fighting alongside the US in Vietnam. A military coup in September 2006 ousted then Prime Minister THAKSIN Chinnawat. December 2007 elections saw the pro-THAKSIN People's Power Party (PPP) emerge at the head of a coalition government that took office in February 2008. The anti-THAKSIN People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD, aka yellow-shirts) in May 2008 began street demonstrations against the new government, eventually occupying the prime minister's office in August and Bangkok's two international airports in November. After an early December 2008 court ruling that dissolved the ruling PPP and two other coalition parties for election violations, the Democrat Party formed a new coalition government and ABHISIT Wetchachiwa became prime minister. In October 2008 THAKSIN fled abroad in advance of an abuse of power conviction and has agitated his followers from abroad since then. THAKSIN supporters under the banner of the United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship (UDD, aka red-shirts) rioted in April 2009, shutting down an ASEAN meeting in Pattaya. Following a February 2010 court verdict confiscating half of THAKSIN's frozen assets, the UDD staged large protests between March and May 2010, and occupied several blocks of downtown Bangkok. Clashes between security forces and protesters, elements of which were armed, resulted in at least 92 deaths and an estimated $1.5 billion in arson-related property losses. These protests exposed major cleavages in the Thai body politic that continue to hamper the current government. The ABHISIT administration has announced a plan for a general election some time in 2011 ahead of its full term by the year-end. Since January 2004, thousands have been killed as separatists in Thailand's southern ethnic Malay-Muslim provinces increased the violence associated with their cause.","geo":{"Location":"Southeastern Asia, bordering the Andaman Sea and the Gulf of Thailand, southeast of Burma","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":15,"min":0},"E":{"deg":100,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total:":{"quantity":513120,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world:":"","land:":{"quantity":510890,"unit":"sq km"},"water:":{"quantity":2230,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly more than twice the size of Wyoming","Land boundaries":{"total:":{"quantity":4863,"unit":"km"},"border countries:":"Burma 1,800 km, Cambodia 803 km, Laos 1,754 km, Malaysia 506 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":3219,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea:":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone:":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf:":"200 m depth or to the depth of exploitation"},"Climate":"tropical;

Thai exports - mostly machinery and electronic components, agricultural commodities, and jewelry - continue to drive the economy, accounting for more than half of GDP. The global financial crisis of 2008-09 severely cut Thailand's exports, with most sectors experiencing double-digit drops. In 2009, the economy contracted 2.2%. In 2010, Thailand's economy expanded 7.6%, its fastest pace since 1995, as exports rebounded from their depressed 2009 level. Antigovernment protests during March-May and the country's polarized political situation had - at most - a temporary impact on business and consumer confidence. Although tourism was hit hard during the protests, its quick recovery helped boost consumer confidence to new highs. Moreover, business and investor sentiment remained buoyant as Thailand's stock market grew almost 5% during the three-month period.

Because of a lack of employment opportunities in Tajikistan, as many as a million Tajik citizens work abroad, almost all of them in Russia, supporting families in Tajikistan through remittances. Less than 7% of the land area is arable. Cotton is the most important crop, and its production is closely monitored, and in many cases controlled, by the government. In the wake of the National Bank of Tajikistan's admission in December 2007 that it had improperly lent money to investors in the cotton sector, the IMF canceled its program in Tajikistan. A reform agenda is underway, according to which over half a billion dollars in farmer debt is being forgiven, and IMF assistance has been reinstated. Mineral resources include silver, gold, uranium, and tungsten. Industry consists only of a large aluminum plant, hydropower facilities, and small obsolete factories mostly in light industry and food processing. The civil war (1992-97) severely damaged the already weak economic infrastructure and caused a sharp decline in industrial and agricultural production. Tajikistan's economic situation remains fragile due to uneven implementation of structural reforms, corruption, weak governance, seasonal power shortages, and the external debt burden. A debt restructuring agreement was reached with Russia in December 2002, including a $250 million write-off of Tajikistan's $300 million debt. Electricity output expanded with the completion of the Sangtuda I hydropower dam - finished in 2009 with Russian investment. The smaller Sangtuda-2, built with Iranian investment, is scheduled for completion in 2012. The government of Tajikistan is pinning major hopes on the massive Roghun dam which, if finished according to Tajik plans, will be the tallest dam in the world. The World Bank has agreed to fund technical, economic, social, and environmental feasibility studies for the dam. Favorable reports from these studies could create investor interest in the project, which is currently moving forward with domestic funding. In January 2010, the government began selling shares in the Roghun enterprise to its population, ultimately raising over $180 million. According to numerous reports, many Tajik individuals and businesses were forced to buy shares. The coerced share sales finally ended in mid-2010 under intense criticism from donors, particularly the IMF. Tajikistan has received substantial infrastructure development loans from the Chinese government to improve roads and electricity transmission. To help increase north-south trade, the US funded a $36 million bridge which opened in August 2007 linking Tajikistan with Afghanistan. While Tajikistan has experienced steady economic growth since 1997, more than half of the population continues to live in poverty. Economic growth reached 10.6% in 2004, but dropped below 8% in 2005-08, as the effects of higher oil prices and then the international financial crisis began to register - mainly in the form of lower prices for key export commodities and lower remittances from Tajiks working abroad.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":14740000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":5642000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":6.5,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":19.2,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":22.6,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":58.1,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":2100000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":49.8,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":12.8,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":37.4,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":2.2,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":53,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":3.3,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":25.6,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":32.6,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":20.9,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":1482000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":1538000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":5.8,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":8,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":22.91,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":863000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":1095000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":1209000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Agriculture - products":"cotton, grain, fruits, grapes, vegetables; cattle, sheep, goats","Industries":"aluminum, cement, vegetable oil","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":7.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":16100000000.000002,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":16700000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":"NA kWh (2008 est.)","Electricity - imports":{"quantity":338500000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":221,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":38000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":348.9,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":10100,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":12000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":16100000.000000002,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":266100000.00000003,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":250000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":5663000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-330 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":1318000000},"Exports - commodities":"aluminum, electricity, cotton, fruits, vegetable oil, textiles","Exports - partners":"Russia 19.16%, China 18.38%, Turkey 12.09%, Iran 11.11%, Uzbekistan 7.92%, Norway 6.17%, Greece 4.32% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":3301000000},"Imports - commodities":"petroleum products, aluminum oxide, machinery and equipment, foodstuffs","Imports - partners":"Russia 23.92%, China 23.74%, Kazakhstan 8.92%, Turkey 4.96%, Uzbekistan 4.73% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":303000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":1997000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":100300000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":18500000000},"Exchange rates":"Tajikistani somoni (TJS) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"tk","name":"Turks and Caicos Islands","region":"Central America and Caribbean","background":"The islands were part of the UK's Jamaican colony until 1962, when they assumed the status of a separate crown colony upon Jamaica's independence.

High unemployment among the young, a continuing upturn in inflation, pressures for democratic reform, and rising civil service expenditures are major issues facing the government.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":751000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":363000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":0.3,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":25,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":17,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":57,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":39960,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":31.8,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":30.6,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":2003,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":13,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":24,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":"NA%","highest 10%:":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":80480000},"expenditures:":{"usd":109800000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":5.9,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":12.47,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":44640000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":153800000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":149200000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Agriculture - products":"squash, coconuts, copra, bananas, vanilla beans, cocoa, coffee, ginger, black pepper; fish","Industries":"tourism, construction, fishing","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":1,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":43000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":39990000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":1000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":1173,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-23 million (2007 est.)","Exports":{"usd":22000000},"Exports - commodities":"squash, fish, vanilla beans, root crops","Exports - partners":"Hong Kong 25.42%, US 22.65%, Japan 12.21%, NZ 7.31%, Fiji 7.2%, Samoa 6.06%, South Korea 4.48% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":139000000},"Imports - commodities":"foodstuffs, machinery and transport equipment, fuels, chemicals","Imports - partners":"Fiji 34.37%, NZ 25.03%, US 9.43%, Australia 7.53%, China 5.64% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":40830000},"Debt - external":{"usd":80700000},"Exchange rates":"pa'anga (TOP) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"to","name":"Togo","region":"Africa","background":"French Togoland became Togo in 1960.

Sao Tome and Principe benefited from $200 million in debt relief in December 2000 under the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) program, which helped bring down the country's $300 million debt burden.

Considerable potential exists for development of a tourist industry, and the government has taken steps to expand facilities in recent years. The government also has attempted to reduce price controls and subsidies. Potential exists for the development of petroleum resources in Sao Tome and Principe's territorial waters in the oil-rich Gulf of Guinea, which are being jointly developed in a 60-40 split with Nigeria, but any actual production is at least several years off.

Governmental control of economic affairs while still heavy has gradually lessened over the past decade with increasing privatization, simplification of the tax structure, and a prudent approach to debt. Progressive social policies also have helped raise living conditions in Tunisia relative to the region. Real growth, which averaged almost 5% over the past decade, declined to 4.6% in 2008 and to 3-4% in 2009-10 because of economic contraction and slowing of import demand in Europe - Tunisia's largest export market. However, development of non-textile manufacturing, a recovery in agricultural production, and strong growth in the services sector somewhat mitigated the economic effect of slowing exports. Tunisia will need to reach even higher growth levels to create sufficient employment opportunities for an already large number of unemployed as well as the growing population of university graduates. The challenges ahead include: privatizing industry, liberalizing the investment code to increase foreign investment, improving government efficiency, reducing the trade deficit, and reducing socioeconomic disparities in the impoverished south and west.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":100000000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":44290000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":3.7,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":10.6,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":34.6,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":54.8,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":3830000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":18.3,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":31.9,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":49.8,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":14,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":3.8,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":2.3,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":31.5,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":40,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":26.1,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":9806000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":11760000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":49.5,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":4.5,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":"NA%","Commercial bank prime lending rate":"NA%","Stock of narrow money":{"usd":11490000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":29390000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":31100000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":9120000000},"Agriculture - products":"olives, olive oil, grain, tomatoes, citrus fruit, sugar beets, dates, almonds; beef, dairy products","Industries":"petroleum, mining (particularly phosphate and iron ore), tourism, textiles, footwear, agribusiness, beverages","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":1.6,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":11080000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":11800000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":130000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":145000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":91380,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":89000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":77130,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":87300,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":425000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":2970000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":4219999999.9999995,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":1250000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":65129999999.99999,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-1.389 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":16110000000},"Exports - commodities":"clothing, semi-finished goods and textiles, agricultural products, mechanical goods, phosphates and chemicals, hydrocarbons, electrical equipment","Exports - partners":"France 29.6%, Italy 21%, Germany 8.8%, Libya 5.8%, Spain 5%, UK 4.8% (2009 est.)","Imports":{"usd":20020000000},"Imports - commodities":"textiles, machinery and equipment, hydrocarbons, chemicals, foodstuffs","Imports - partners":"France 20.1%, Italy 16.4%, Germany 8.8%, China 5%, Spain 4.5%, US 4% (2009 est.)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":11230000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":18760000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":33560000000.000004},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":251000000},"Exchange rates":"Tunisian dinars (TND) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"tt","name":"Timor-Leste","region":"East & Southeast Asia","background":"The Portuguese began to trade with the island of Timor in the early 16th century and colonized it in mid-century. Skirmishing with the Dutch in the region eventually resulted in an 1859 treaty in which Portugal ceded the western portion of the island. Imperial Japan occupied Portuguese Timor from 1942 to 1945, but Portugal resumed colonial authority after the Japanese defeat in World War II. East Timor declared itself independent from Portugal on 28 November 1975 and was invaded and occupied by Indonesian forces nine days later. It was incorporated into Indonesia in July 1976 as the province of Timor Timur (East Timor). An unsuccessful campaign of pacification followed over the next two decades, during which an estimated 100,000 to 250,000 individuals lost their lives. On 30 August 1999, in a UN-supervised popular referendum, an overwhelming majority of the people of Timor-Leste voted for independence from Indonesia. Between the referendum and the arrival of a multinational peacekeeping force in late September 1999, anti-independence Timorese militias - organized and supported by the Indonesian military - commenced a large-scale, scorched-earth campaign of retribution. The militias killed approximately 1,400 Timorese and forcibly pushed 300,000 people into western Timor as refugees. Most of the country's infrastructure, including homes, irrigation systems, water supply systems, and schools, and nearly 100% of the country's electrical grid were destroyed. On 20 September 1999, the Australian-led peacekeeping troops of the International Force for East Timor (INTERFET) deployed to the country and brought the violence to an end. On 20 May 2002, Timor-Leste was internationally recognized as an independent state. In late April 2006, internal tensions threatened the new nation's security when a military strike led to violence and a near breakdown of law and order. At Dili's request, an Australian-led International Stabilization Force (ISF) deployed to Timor-Leste in late May. In August, the UN Security Council established the UN Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT), which included an authorized police presence of over 1,600 personnel. The ISF and UNMIT restored stability, allowing for presidential and parliamentary elections in April and June 2007 in a largely peaceful atmosphere. In February 2008, a rebel group staged an unsuccessful attack against the president and prime minister. The ringleader was killed in the attack and most of the rebels surrendered in April 2008. Since the unsuccessful attacks the government has enjoyed one of its longest periods of post-independence stability.","geo":{"Location":"Southeastern Asia, northwest of Australia in the Lesser Sunda Islands at the eastern end of the Indonesian archipelago;

Three hundred thousand people fled westward. Over the next three years a massive international program, manned by 5,000 peacekeepers (8,000 at peak) and 1,300 police officers, led to substantial reconstruction in both urban and rural areas. By the end of 2005, refugees had returned or had settled in Indonesia. The country continues to face great challenges in rebuilding its infrastructure, strengthening the civil administration, and generating jobs for young people entering the work force. The development of oil and gas resources in offshore waters has greatly supplemented government revenues. This technology-intensive industry, however, has done little to create jobs for the unemployed because there are no production facilities in Timor-Leste. Gas is piped to Australia. In June 2005, the National Parliament unanimously approved the creation of a Petroleum Fund to serve as a repository for all petroleum revenues and to preserve the value of Timor-Leste's petroleum wealth for future generations. The Fund held assets of US$6.6 billion as of October 2010. The economy continues to recover strongly from the mid-2006 outbreak of violence and civil unrest, which disrupted both private and public sector economic activity. The government in 2008 resettled tens of thousands of an estimated 100,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs); most IDPs returned home by early 2009. Government spending increased markedly in 2009 and 2010, primarily on basic infrastructure, including electricity and roads. Limited experience in procurement and infrastructure building has hampered these projects. The underlying economic policy challenge the country faces remains how best to use oil-and-gas wealth to lift the non-oil economy onto a higher growth path and to reduce poverty.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":3051000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":628000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":6.1,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":32.2,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":12.8,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":55,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":414200,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":90,"unit":"%"},"industry:":"NA%","services:":"NA% (2006 est.)"},"Unemployment rate":{"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":20,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":42,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":2.9,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":31.3,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":38,"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":1481000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":838000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":7.8,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":11.17,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":102800000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":268399999.99999997},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":127100000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Agriculture - products":"coffee, rice, corn, cassava, sweet potatoes, soybeans, cabbage, mangoes, bananas, vanilla","Industries":"printing, soap manufacturing, handicrafts, woven cloth","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":8.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":"NA kWh (2009 est.)","Electricity - consumption":"NA kWh","Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":96270,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":2500,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":100900,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":553800000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":200000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":1161000000},"Exports":"$10 million (2005 est.); note - excludes oil","Exports - commodities":"coffee, sandalwood, marble; note - potential for oil and vanilla exports","Imports":{"usd":202000000},"Imports - commodities":"food, gasoline, kerosene, machinery","Exchange rates":"the US dollar is used"}},{"id":"tu","name":"Turkey","region":"Middle East","background":"Modern Turkey was founded in 1923 from the Anatolian remnants of the defeated Ottoman Empire by national hero Mustafa KEMAL, who was later honored with the title Ataturk or \"Father of the Turks.\" Under his authoritarian leadership, the country adopted wide-ranging social, legal, and political reforms. After a period of one-party rule, an experiment with multi-party politics led to the 1950 election victory of the opposition Democratic Party and the peaceful transfer of power. Since then, Turkish political parties have multiplied, but democracy has been fractured by periods of instability and intermittent military coups (1960, 1971, 1980), which in each case eventually resulted in a return of political power to civilians. In 1997, the military again helped engineer the ouster - popularly dubbed a \"post-modern coup\" - of the then Islamic-oriented government. Turkey intervened militarily on Cyprus in 1974 to prevent a Greek takeover of the island and has since acted as patron state to the \"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus,\" which only Turkey recognizes. A separatist insurgency begun in 1984 by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) - now known as the People's Congress of Kurdistan or Kongra-Gel (KGK) - has dominated the Turkish military's attention and claimed more than 30,000 lives. After the capture of the group's leader in 1999, the insurgents largely withdrew from Turkey mainly to northern Iraq. In 2004, KGK announced an end to its ceasefire and attacks attributed to the KGK increased. Turkey joined the UN in 1945 and in 1952 it became a member of NATO. In 1964, Turkey became an associate member of the European Community.

Turkey's traditional textiles and clothing sectors still account for one-third of industrial employment, despite stiff competition in international markets that resulted from the end of the global quota system. Other sectors, notably the automotive, construction, and electronics industries, are rising in importance and have surpassed textiles within Turkey's export mix. Oil began to flow through the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline in May 2006, marking a major milestone that will bring up to 1 million barrels per day from the Caspian to market. Several gas pipelines also are being planned to help move Central Asian gas to Europe via Turkey, which will help address Turkey's dependence on energy imports over the long term. After Turkey experienced a severe financial crisis in 2001, Ankara adopted financial and fiscal reforms as part of an IMF program. The reforms strengthened the country's economic fundamentals and ushered in an era of strong growth - averaging more than 6% annually until 2008, when global economic conditions and tighter fiscal policy caused GDP to contract in 2009, reduced inflation to 6.3% - a 34-year low - and cut the public sector debt-to-GPD ratio below 50%. Turkey's well-regulated financial markets and banking system weathered the global financial crisis and GDP rebounded strongly to 7.3% in 2010, as exports returned to normal levels following the recession. The economy, however, continues to be burdened by a high current account deficit and remains dependent on often volatile, short-term investment to finance its trade deficit. The stock value of FDI stood at $174 billion at year-end 2010, but inflows have slowed considerably in light of continuing economic turmoil in Europe, the source of much of Turkey's FDI. Further economic and judicial reforms and prospective EU membership are expected to boost Turkey's attractiveness to foreign investors. However, Turkey's relatively high current account deficit, uncertainty related to policy-making, and fiscal imbalances leave the economy vulnerable to destabilizing shifts in investor confidence.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":960500000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":741900000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":8.2,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":8.8,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":25.7,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":65.5,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":{"Labor force":24730000,"country comparison to the world:":""},"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":29.5,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":24.7,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":45.8,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":12.4,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":17.11,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":1.9,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":33.2,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":41,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":18,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":159400000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":189600000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":48.1,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":8.7,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":15,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":"NA%","Stock of narrow money":{"usd":57020000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":255500000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":401800000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":225700000000},"Agriculture - products":"tobacco, cotton, grain, olives, sugar beets, hazelnuts, pulse, citrus; livestock","Industries":"textiles, food processing, autos, electronics, mining (coal, chromate, copper, boron), steel, petroleum, construction, lumber, paper","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":6,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":198400000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":198100000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":1120000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":790000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":52980,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":579500,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":133100,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":734600,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":262200000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":1014000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":35070000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":708000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":35770000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":6088000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-38.82 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":117400000000},"Exports - commodities":"apparel, foodstuffs, textiles, metal manufactures, transport equipment","Exports - partners":"Germany 9.6%, France 6.1%, UK 5.8%, Italy 5.8%, Iraq 5% (2009 est.)","Imports":{"usd":166300000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery, chemicals, semi-finished goods, fuels, transport equipment","Imports - partners":"Russia 14%, Germany 10%, China 9%, US 6.1%, Italy 5.4%, France 5% (2009 est.)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":78000000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":270700000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":84450000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":16420000000.000002},"Exchange rates":"Turkish liras (TRY) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"tv","name":"Tuvalu","region":"Australia-Oceania","background":"In 1974, ethnic differences within the British colony of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands caused the Polynesians of the Ellice Islands to vote for separation from the Micronesians of the Gilbert Islands.

The country has no known mineral resources and few exports and is almost entirely dependent upon imported food and fuel. Subsistence farming and fishing are the primary economic activities. Fewer than 1,000 tourists, on average, visit Tuvalu annually. Job opportunities are scarce and public sector workers make up most of those employed. About 15% of the adult male population work as seamen on merchant ships abroad, and remittances are a vital source of income contributing around $2 million in 2007. Substantial income is received annually from the Tuvalu Trust Fund (TTF) an international trust fund established in 1987 by Australia, NZ, and the UK and supported also by Japan and South Korea. Thanks to wise investments and conservative withdrawals, this fund grew from an initial $17 million to an estimated value of $77 million in 2006. The TTF contributed nearly $9 million towards the government budget in 2006 and is an important cushion for meeting shortfalls in the government's budget. The US Government is also a major revenue source for Tuvalu because of payments from a 1988 treaty on fisheries. In an effort to ensure financial stability and sustainability, the government is pursuing public sector reforms, including privatization of some government functions and personnel cuts. Tuvalu also derives royalties from the lease of its \".tv\" Internet domain name with revenue of more than $2 million in 2006. A minor source of government revenue comes from the sale of stamps and coins. With merchandise exports only a fraction of merchandise imports, continued reliance must be placed on fishing and telecommunications license fees, remittances from overseas workers, official transfers, and income from overseas investments. Growing income disparities and the vulnerability of the country to climatic change are among leading concerns for the nation.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":36000000},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":32000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":0.2,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":16.6,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":27.2,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":56.2,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":3615,"Labor force - by occupation":{"note:":"people make a living mainly through exploitation of the sea, reefs, and atolls and from wages sent home by those abroad (mostly workers in the phosphate industry and sailors)"},"Unemployment rate":"NA%","Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":"NA%","highest 10%:":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":21540000},"expenditures:":{"usd":23050000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":3.8,"unit":"%"},"Agriculture - products":"coconuts; fish","Industries":"fishing, tourism, copra","Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Current account balance":"$-11.68 million (2003)","Exports":{"usd":1000000},"Exports - commodities":"copra, fish","Imports":{"usd":12910000},"Imports - commodities":"food, animals, mineral fuels, machinery, manufactured goods","Debt - external":"$NA","Exchange rates":"Tuvaluan dollars or Australian dollars (AUD) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"tw","name":"Taiwan","region":"East & Southeast Asia","background":"In 1895, military defeat forced China to cede Taiwan to Japan.

In keeping with this trend, some large, state-owned banks and industrial firms have been privatized. Exports, led by electronics and machinery, generate about 70% of Taiwan's GDP growth, and have provided the primary impetus for economic development. This heavy dependence on exports exposes the economy to upturns and downturns in world demand. In 2009, Taiwan's GDP contracted 1.9%, due primarily to a 20% year-on-year decline in exports. In 2010 GDP grew 10.5%, as exports returned to the level of previous years. Taiwan's diplomatic isolation, low birth rate, and rapidly aging population are major long-term challenges. Free trade agreements have proliferated in East Asia over the past several years, but so far Taiwan has been excluded from this greater economic integration, largely because of its diplomatic status. Taiwan's Total Fertility rate of just over one child per woman is among the lowest in the world, raising the prospect of future labor shortages, falling domestic demand, and declining tax revenues. Taiwan's population is aging quickly, with the number of people over 65 accounting for 10.9% of the island's total population as 2011. The island runs a large trade surplus, and its foreign reserves are the world's fourth largest, behind China, Japan, and Russia. Since President MA Ying-jeou took office in May 2008, cross-Strait economic ties have increased significantly. Since 2005 China has overtaken the US to become Taiwan's second-largest source of imports after Japan. China is also the island's number one destination for foreign direct investment. Taiwan has focused much of its efforts on improving the cross-Strait economic relationship. Three financial memorandums of understanding, covering banking, securities, and insurance, took effect in mid-January 2010, opening the island to greater investments from the mainland's financial firms and institutional investors, and providing new opportunities for Taiwan financial firms to operate in China. Taiwan and the mainland in June 2010 signed the landmark Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA), an agreement that the Taiwan authorities hope will eventually lead to a free-trade arrangement that will increase cross-Strait economic ties by lowering tariffs on a number of goods and by reducing market access barriers for services. The Taiwan authorities have said that the ECFA will serve as a stepping stone toward trade pacts with other regional partners and they announced that formal negotiations towards an economic cooperation agreement with Singapore would begin in 2011. Closer economic links with the mainland brings greater opportunities for the Taiwan economy, but also poses new challenges. For example, FDI in China has resulted in Chinese import substitution away from Taiwan's exports and a restriction of potential job creation in Taiwan.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":821800000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":430600000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":10.8,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":1.4,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":31.1,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":67.5,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":11070000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":5.2,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":35.9,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":58.8,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":5.2,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":1.16,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":6.4,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":40.3,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":32.6,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":21.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":72240000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":79650000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":33.9,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":1.625,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":2.68,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":377300000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":1022000000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":751500000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":784100000000},"Agriculture - products":"rice, vegetables, fruit, tea, flowers; pigs, poultry; fish","Industries":"electronics, communications and information technology products, petroleum refining, armaments, chemicals, textiles, iron and steel, machinery, cement, food processing, vehicles, consumer products, pharmaceuticals","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":26.4,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":229100000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":220800000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":276800,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":834000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":303000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":876300,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":2800000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":350700000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":11630000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":11590000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":6229000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":39000000000},"Exports":{"usd":274600000000.00003},"Exports - commodities":"electronics, flat panels, machinery; metals; textiles, plastics, chemicals; optical, photographic, measuring, and medical instruments","Exports - partners":"China 28.1%, Hong Kong 13.8%, US 11.5%, Japan 6.6%, Singapore 4.4% (2010 est.)","Imports":{"usd":251400000000},"Imports - commodities":"electronics, machinery, crude petroleum, precision instruments, organic chemicals, metals","Imports - partners":"Japan 20.7%, China 14.2%, US 10%, South Korea 6.4%, Saudi Arabia 4.7% (2010 est.)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":387200000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":91410000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":111100000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":162900000000},"Exchange rates":"New Taiwan dollars (TWD) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"tx","name":"Turkmenistan","region":"Central Asia","background":"Eastern Turkmenistan for centuries formed part of the Persian province of Khurasan; in medieval times Merv (today known as Mary) was one of the great cities of the Islamic world and an important stop on the Silk Road.

Extensive hydrocarbon/natural gas reserves could prove a boon to this underdeveloped country once extraction and delivery projects are expanded. The Turkmen Government is actively working to diversify its gas export routes beyond the still dominant Russian pipeline network. In 2010, new gas export pipelines that carry Turkmen gas to China and to northern Iran began operating, effectively ending the Russian monopoly on Turkmen gas exports.

Gurbanguly BERDIMUHAMEDOW, a deputy cabinet chairman under NYYAZOW, emerged as the country's new president.","geo":{"Location":"Central Asia, bordering the Caspian Sea, between Iran and Kazakhstan","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":40,"min":0},"E":{"deg":60,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total:":{"quantity":488100,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world:":"","land:":{"quantity":469930,"unit":"sq km"},"water:":{"quantity":18170,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly larger than California","Land boundaries":{"total:":{"quantity":3736,"unit":"km"},"border countries:":"Afghanistan 744 km, Iran 992 km, Kazakhstan 379 km, Uzbekistan 1,621 km"},"Coastline":"0 km; note - Turkmenistan borders the Caspian Sea (1,768 km)","Maritime claims":"none (landlocked)","Climate":"subtropical desert","Terrain":"flat-to-rolling sandy desert with dunes rising to mountains in the south; low mountains along border with Iran; borders Caspian Sea in west","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point:":"Vpadina Akchanaya -81 m","highest point:":"Gora Ayribaba 3,139 m"},"Natural resources":"petroleum, natural gas, sulfur, salt","Land use":{"arable land:":{"quantity":4.51,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops:":{"quantity":0.14,"unit":"%"},"other:":{"quantity":95.35,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":18000,"unit":"sq km"},"Total renewable water resources":{"quantity":60.9,"unit":"cu km"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total:":{"quantity":24.65,"unit":"cu km/yr"},"per capita:":{"quantity":5104,"unit":"cu m/yr"}},"Natural hazards":"NA","Environment - current issues":"contamination of soil and groundwater with agricultural chemicals, pesticides; salination, water logging of soil due to poor irrigation methods; Caspian Sea pollution; diversion of a large share of the flow of the Amu Darya into irrigation contributes to that river's inability to replenish the Aral Sea; desertification","Environment - international agreements":{"party to:":"Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Hazardous Wastes, Ozone Layer Protection","signed, but not ratified:":"none of the selected agreements"},"Geography - note":"landlocked; the western and central low-lying desolate portions of the country make up the great Garagum (Kara-Kum) desert, which occupies over 80% of the country; eastern part is plateau"},"people":{"Population":4997,"Age structure":{"0-14 years:":{"quantity":27.5,"unit":"%"},"15-64 years:":{"quantity":68.4,"unit":"%"},"65 years and over:":"4.1% (male 88,590/female 115,324) (2011 est.)"},"Median age":{"total:":{"quantity":25.3,"unit":"years"},"male:":{"quantity":24.9,"unit":"years"},"female:":{"quantity":25.8,"unit":"years"}},"Population growth rate":{"quantity":1.138,"unit":"%"},"Birth rate":{"quantity":19.54,"unit":"births/1,000 population"},"Death rate":{"quantity":6.24,"unit":"deaths/1,000 population"},"Net migration rate":"-1.92 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2011 est.)","Urbanization":{"urban population:":{"quantity":50,"unit":"% of total population"},"rate of urbanization:":{"quantity":2.2,"unit":"% annual rate of change"}},"Major cities - population":"ASHGABAT (capital) 637,000 (2009)","Sex ratio":{"at birth:":{"quantity":1.05,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"under 15 years:":{"quantity":1.02,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"15-64 years:":{"quantity":0.98,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"65 years and over:":{"quantity":0.77,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"total population:":{"quantity":0.98,"unit":"male(s)/female"}},"Infant mortality rate":{"total:":{"quantity":42.34,"unit":"deaths/1,000 live births"},"country comparison to the world:":"","male:":{"quantity":50.42,"unit":"deaths/1,000 live births"},"female:":{"quantity":33.85,"unit":"deaths/1,000 live births"}},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population:":{"quantity":68.52,"unit":"years"},"country comparison to the world:":"","male:":{"quantity":65.57,"unit":"years"},"female:":{"quantity":71.63,"unit":"years"}},"Total fertility rate":{"quantity":2.16,"unit":"children born/woman"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":"less than 0.1% (2007 est.)","HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":"fewer than 200 (2007 est.)","HIV/AIDS - deaths":"fewer than 100 (2004 est.)","Drinking water source":{},"Sanitation facility access":{},"Nationality":{"noun:":"Turkmen(s)","adjective:":"Turkmen"},"Ethnic groups":"Turkmen 85%, Uzbek 5%, Russian 4%, other 6% (2003)","Religions":"Muslim 89%, Eastern Orthodox 9%, unknown 2%","Languages":"Turkmen (official) 72%, Russian 12%, Uzbek 9%, other 7%","Literacy":{"definition:":"age 15 and over can read and write","total population:":{"quantity":98.8,"unit":"%"},"male:":{"quantity":99.3,"unit":"%"},"female:":{"quantity":98.3,"unit":"%"}},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":"NA","Education expenditures":"NA"},"economy":{"Economy - overview":"Turkmenistan is largely a desert country with intensive agriculture in irrigated oases and sizeable gas and oil resources. The two largest crops are cotton, most of which is produced for export, and wheat, which is domestically consumed. Although agriculture accounts for roughly 10% of GDP, it continues to employ nearly half of the country's workforce. With an authoritarian ex-Communist regime in power and a tribally based social structure, Turkmenistan has taken a cautious approach to economic reform, hoping to use gas and cotton export revenues to sustain its inefficient economy. Privatization goals remain limited. From 1998-2005, Turkmenistan suffered from the continued lack of adequate export routes for natural gas and from obligations on extensive short-term external debt. At the same time, however, total exports rose by an average of roughly 15% per year from 2003-08, largely because of higher international oil and gas prices. New pipelines to China and Iran, that began operation in early 2010, have given Turkmenistan additional export routes for its gas, although these new routes have not offset the sharp drop in export revenue since early 2009 from decreased gas exports to Russia. Overall prospects in the near future are discouraging because of widespread internal poverty, endemic corruption, a poor educational system, government misuse of oil and gas revenues, and Ashgabat's reluctance to adopt market-oriented reforms. In the past, Turkmenistan's economic statistics were state secrets. The new government has established a State Agency for Statistics, but GDP numbers and other figures are subject to wide margins of error. In particular, the rate of GDP growth is uncertain. Since his election, President BERDIMUHAMEDOW unified the country's dual currency exchange rate, ordered the redenomination of the manat, reduced state subsidies for gasoline, and initiated development of a special tourism zone on the Caspian Sea. Although foreign investment is encouraged, numerous bureaucratic obstacles impede international business activity.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":36900000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":27960000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":9.2,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":10.2,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":30,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":59.8,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":2300000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":48.2,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":14,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":37.8,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":60,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":30,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":2.6,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":31.7,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":40.8,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":12.4,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":1970000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":1878000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":12,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":573000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":1052999999.9999999},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":2089000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Agriculture - products":"cotton, grain; livestock","Industries":"natural gas, oil, petroleum products, textiles, food processing","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":7.3,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":15500000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":13000000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":2500000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":197700,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":120000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":38360,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":600000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":34000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":20000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":14000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":7504000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":3081000000},"Exports":{"usd":9672000000},"Exports - commodities":"gas, crude oil, petrochemicals, textiles, cotton fiber","Exports - partners":"Ukraine 22.3%, Turkey 10.27%, Hungary 6.75%, UAE 6.25%, Poland 6.16%, Afghanistan 5.79%, Iran 5.17% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":4888000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery and equipment, chemicals, foodstuffs","Imports - partners":"China 18.03%, Turkey 16.49%, Russia 16.45%, Germany 5.91%, UAE 5.81%, Ukraine 5.67%, US 5.41%, France 4.32% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":10810000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":5000000000},"Exchange rates":"Turkmen manat (TMM) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"tz","name":"Tanzania","region":"Africa","background":"Shortly after achieving independence from Britain in the early 1960s, Tanganyika and Zanzibar merged to form the nation of Tanzania in 1964.

The World Bank, the IMF, and bilateral donors have provided funds to rehabilitate Tanzania's aging economic infrastructure, including rail and port infrastructure that are important trade links for inland countries. Recent banking reforms have helped increase private-sector growth and investment, and the government has increased spending on agriculture to 7% of its budget. Continued donor assistance and solid macroeconomic policies supported a positive growth rate, despite the world recession. In 2008, Tanzania received the world's largest Millennium Challenge Compact grant, worth $698 million. Dar es Salaam used fiscal stimulus and loosened monetary policy to ease the impact of the global recession.

Since 1986, the government - with the support of foreign countries and international agencies - has acted to rehabilitate and stabilize the economy by undertaking currency reform, raising producer prices on export crops, increasing prices of petroleum products, and improving civil service wages. The policy changes are especially aimed at dampening inflation and boosting production and export earnings. Since 1990 economic reforms ushered in an era of solid economic growth based on continued investment in infrastructure, improved incentives for production and exports, lower inflation, better domestic security, and the return of exiled Indian-Ugandan entrepreneurs. Uganda has received about $2 billion in multilateral and bilateral debt relief. In 2007 Uganda received $10 million for a Millennium Challenge Account Threshold Program. The global economic downturn has hurt Uganda's exports; however, Uganda's GDP growth is still relatively strong due to past reforms and sound management of the downturn. Oil revenues and taxes will become a larger source of government funding as oil comes on line in the next few years. Instability in southern Sudan is the biggest risk for the Ugandan economy in 2011 because Uganda's main export partner is Sudan, and Uganda is a key destination for Sudanese refugees.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":42150000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":17010000000.000002},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":5.2,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":23.6,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":24.5,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":51.9,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":15510000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":82,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":5,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":13,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":"NA%","Population below poverty line":{"quantity":35,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":2.6,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":34.1,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":45.7,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":20.9,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":2457000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":2938000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":20.4,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":9.4,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":9.65,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":20.96,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":1997000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":3905000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":1882000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA (31 December 2010)","Agriculture - products":"coffee, tea, cotton, tobacco, cassava (tapioca), potatoes, corn, millet, pulses, cut flowers; beef, goat meat, milk, poultry","Industries":"sugar, brewing, tobacco, cotton textiles; cement, steel production","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":6,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":2256000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":2068000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":30000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":13000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":13090,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":1500000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-784 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":2941000000},"Exports - commodities":"coffee, fish and fish products, tea, cotton, flowers, horticultural products; gold","Exports - partners":"Sudan 13.47%, Kenya 8.98%, UAE 7.52%, Rwanda 7.5%, Switzerland 7.42%, Democratic Republic of the Congo 6.85%, Netherlands 5.67%, Belgium 5.66%, Germany 5.18%, Italy 4.33% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":4474000000},"Imports - commodities":"capital equipment, vehicles, petroleum, medical supplies; cereals","Imports - partners":"Kenya 13.9%, India 12.79%, UAE 11.16%, China 8.91%, South Africa 5.08%, France 4.6%, Japan 4.37%, US 4.07% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":3743000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Debt - external":{"usd":2888000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":"$NA","Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA","Exchange rates":"Ugandan shillings (UGX) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"uk","name":"United Kingdom","region":"Europe","background":"The United Kingdom has historically played a leading role in developing parliamentary democracy and in advancing literature and science.

Over the past two decades, the government has greatly reduced public ownership and contained the growth of social welfare programs. Agriculture is intensive, highly mechanized, and efficient by European standards, producing about 60% of food needs with less than 2% of the labor force. The UK has large coal, natural gas, and oil resources, but its oil and natural gas reserves are declining and the UK became a net importer of energy in 2005. Services, particularly banking, insurance, and business services, account by far for the largest proportion of GDP while industry continues to decline in importance. After emerging from recession in 1992, Britain's economy enjoyed the longest period of expansion on record during which time growth outpaced most of Western Europe. In 2008, however, the global financial crisis hit the economy particularly hard, due to the importance of its financial sector. Sharply declining home prices, high consumer debt, and the global economic slowdown compounded Britain's economic problems, pushing the economy into recession in the latter half of 2008 and prompting the then BROWN government to implement a number of measures to stimulate the economy and stabilize the financial markets; these include nationalizing parts of the banking system, cutting taxes, suspending public sector borrowing rules, and moving forward public spending on capital projects. Facing burgeoning public deficits and debt levels, the CAMERON government in 2010 initiated a five-year austerity program, which aims to lower London's budget deficit from over 11% of GDP in 2010 to nearly 1% by 2015. The Bank of England periodically coordinates interest rate moves with the European Central Bank, but Britain remains outside the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":2173000000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":2247000000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":1.3,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":0.9,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":22.1,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":77.1,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":31450000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":1.4,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":18.2,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":80.4,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":7.9,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":14,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":2.1,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":28.5,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":34,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":14.4,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":926700000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":1154000000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":76.5,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":3.3,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":"NA% (31 December 2009)","Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":0.63,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":88620000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":3344000000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":5151000000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":2796000000000},"Agriculture - products":"cereals, oilseed, potatoes, vegetables; cattle, sheep, poultry; fish","Industries":"machine tools, electric power equipment, automation equipment, railroad equipment, shipbuilding, aircraft, motor vehicles and parts, electronics and communications equipment, metals, chemicals, coal, petroleum, paper and paper products, food processing, textiles, clothing, other consumer goods","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":1.9,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":368600000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":345800000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":1272000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":12290000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":1502000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":1669000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":1393000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":1491000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":3084000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":58560000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":87450000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":12170000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":41060000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":292000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-40.34 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":405600000000},"Exports - commodities":"manufactured goods, fuels, chemicals; food, beverages, tobacco","Exports - partners":"US 14.71%, Germany 11.06%, France 8%, Netherlands 7.79%, Ireland 6.89%, Belgium 4.65%, Spain 4% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":546500000000},"Imports - commodities":"manufactured goods, machinery, fuels; foodstuffs","Imports - partners":"Germany 12.87%, US 9.74%, China 8.88%, Netherlands 6.94%, France 6.64%, Belgium 4.86%, Norway 4.84%, Ireland 4.01%, Italy 3.99% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":"$NA (31 December 2010 est.)","Debt - external":{"usd":8981000000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":1169000000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":1705000000000},"Exchange rates":"British pounds (GBP) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"um","name":"United States Pacific Island Wildlife Refuges","region":"Australia-Oceania","background":"All of the following US Pacific island territories except Midway Atoll constitute the Pacific Remote Islands National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) Complex and as such are managed by the Fish and Wildlife Service of the US Department of the Interior.

Despite continuous Muscovite pressure, the Hetmanate managed to remain autonomous for well over 100 years. During the latter part of the 18th century, most Ukrainian ethnographic territory was absorbed by the Russian Empire. Following the collapse of czarist Russia in 1917, Ukraine was able to achieve a short-lived period of independence (1917-20), but was reconquered and forced to endure a brutal Soviet rule that engineered two forced famines (1921-22 and 1932-33) in which over 8 million died. In World War II, German and Soviet armies were responsible for some 7 to 8 million more deaths. Although final independence for Ukraine was achieved in 1991 with the dissolution of the USSR, democracy and prosperity remained elusive as the legacy of state control and endemic corruption stalled efforts at economic reform, privatization, and civil liberties. A peaceful mass protest \"Orange Revolution\" in the closing months of 2004 forced the authorities to overturn a rigged presidential election and to allow a new internationally monitored vote that swept into power a reformist slate under Viktor YUSHCHENKO. Subsequent internal squabbles in the YUSHCHENKO camp allowed his rival Viktor YANUKOVYCH to stage a comeback in parliamentary elections and become prime minister in August of 2006. An early legislative election, brought on by a political crisis in the spring of 2007, saw Yuliya TYMOSHENKO, as head of an \"Orange\" coalition, installed as a new prime minister in December 2007. Viktor YANUKOVUYCH was elected president in a February 2010 run-off election that observers assessed as meeting most international standards. The following month, the Rada approved a vote of no-confidence prompting Yuliya TYMOSHENKO to resign from her post as prime minister.","geo":{"Location":"Eastern Europe, bordering the Black Sea, between Poland, Romania, and Moldova in the west and Russia in the east","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":49,"min":0},"E":{"deg":32,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total:":{"quantity":603550,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world:":"","land:":{"quantity":579330,"unit":"sq km"},"water:":{"quantity":24220,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than Texas","Land boundaries":{"total:":{"quantity":4566,"unit":"km"},"border countries:":"Belarus 891 km, Hungary 103 km, Moldova 940 km, Poland 428 km, Romania (south) 176 km, Romania (southwest) 362 km, Russia 1,576 km, Slovakia 90 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":2782,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea:":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone:":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf:":"200 m or to the depth of exploitation"},"Climate":"temperate continental;

Its fertile black soil generated more than one-fourth of Soviet agricultural output, and its farms provided substantial quantities of meat, milk, grain, and vegetables to other republics. Likewise, its diversified heavy industry supplied the unique equipment (for example, large diameter pipes) and raw materials to industrial and mining sites (vertical drilling apparatus) in other regions of the former USSR. Shortly after independence in August 1991, the Ukrainian Government liberalized most prices and erected a legal framework for privatization, but widespread resistance to reform within the government and the legislature soon stalled reform efforts and led to some backtracking. Output by 1999 had fallen to less than 40% of the 1991 level. Ukraine's dependence on Russia for energy supplies and the lack of significant structural reform have made the Ukrainian economy vulnerable to external shocks. Ukraine depends on imports to meet about three-fourths of its annual oil and natural gas requirements and 100% of its nuclear fuel needs. After a two-week dispute that saw gas supplies cutoff to Europe, Ukraine agreed to 10-year gas supply and transit contracts with Russia in January 2009 that brought gas prices to \"world\" levels. The strict terms of the contracts have further hobbled Ukraine's cash-strapped state gas company, Naftohaz. Outside institutions - particularly the IMF - have encouraged Ukraine to quicken the pace and scope of reforms. Ukrainian Government officials eliminated most tax and customs privileges in a March 2005 budget law, bringing more economic activity out of Ukraine's large shadow economy, but more improvements are needed, including fighting corruption, developing capital markets, and improving the legislative framework. Ukraine's economy was buoyant despite political turmoil between the prime minister and president until mid-2008. Real GDP growth exceeded 7% in 2006-07, fueled by high global prices for steel - Ukraine's top export - and by strong domestic consumption, spurred by rising pensions and wages. Ukraine reached an agreement with the IMF for a $16.4 billion Stand-By Arrangement in November 2008 to deal with the economic crisis, but the Ukrainian Government's lack of progress in implementing reforms has twice delayed the release of IMF assistance funds. The drop in steel prices and Ukraine's exposure to the global financial crisis due to aggressive foreign borrowing lowered growth in 2008 and the economy contracted more than 15% in 2009, among the worst economic performances in the world; growth resumed in 2010, buoyed by exports. External conditions are likely to hamper efforts for economic recovery in 2011.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":305200000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":136400000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":4.2,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":9.8,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":32.3,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":57.9,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":22060000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":15.8,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":18.5,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":65.7,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":8.4,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":35,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":3.4,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":25.7,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":31,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":16.1,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":41180000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":49790000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":38.4,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":9.8,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":10.25,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":20.86,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":34970000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":73910000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":110800000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":16790000000},"Agriculture - products":"grain, sugar beets, sunflower seeds, vegetables; beef, milk","Industries":"coal, electric power, ferrous and nonferrous metals, machinery and transport equipment, chemicals, food processing","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":8,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":172900000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":134600000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":4000000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":99930,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":348000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":154400,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":147600,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":395000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":21200000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":52000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":5000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":26830000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":1104000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":603000000},"Exports":{"usd":49710000000},"Exports - commodities":"ferrous and nonferrous metals, fuel and petroleum products, chemicals, machinery and transport equipment, food products","Exports - partners":"Russia 21.1%, Turkey 5.3%, China 3.8% (2009 est.)","Imports":{"usd":53540000000},"Imports - commodities":"energy, machinery and equipment, chemicals","Imports - partners":"Russia 28%, Germany 8.6%, China 6.1%, Kazakhstan 4.9%, Poland 4.9% (2009 est.)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":32909999999.999996},"Debt - external":{"usd":97500000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":52310000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":2327000000},"Exchange rates":"hryvnia (UAH) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"us","name":"United States","region":"North America","background":"Britain's American colonies broke with the mother country in 1776 and were recognized as the new nation of the United States of America following the Treaty of Paris in 1783.

In this market-oriented economy, private individuals and business firms make most of the decisions, and the federal and state governments buy needed goods and services predominantly in the private marketplace. US business firms enjoy greater flexibility than their counterparts in Western Europe and Japan in decisions to expand capital plant, to lay off surplus workers, and to develop new products. At the same time, they face higher barriers to enter their rivals' home markets than foreign firms face entering US markets. US firms are at or near the forefront in technological advances, especially in computers and in medical, aerospace, and military equipment; their advantage has narrowed since the end of World War II. The onrush of technology largely explains the gradual development of a \"two-tier labor market\" in which those at the bottom lack the education and the professional/technical skills of those at the top and, more and more, fail to get comparable pay raises, health insurance coverage, and other benefits. Since 1975, practically all the gains in household income have gone to the top 20% of households. The war in March-April 2003 between a US-led coalition and Iraq, and the subsequent occupation of Iraq, required major shifts in national resources to the military. Soaring oil prices between 2005 and the first half of 2008 threatened inflation and unemployment, as higher gasoline prices ate into consumers' budgets. Imported oil accounts for about 60% of US consumption. Long-term problems include inadequate investment in economic infrastructure, rapidly rising medical and pension costs of an aging population, sizable trade and budget deficits, and stagnation of family income in the lower economic groups. The merchandise trade deficit reached a record $840 billion in 2008 before shrinking to $506 billion in 2009, and ramping back up to $630 billion in 2010. The global economic downturn, the sub-prime mortgage crisis, investment bank failures, falling home prices, and tight credit pushed the United States into a recession by mid-2008. GDP contracted until the third quarter of 2009, making this the deepest and longest downturn since the Great Depression. To help stabilize financial markets, the US Congress established a $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) in October 2008. The government used some of these funds to purchase equity in US banks and other industrial corporations, much of which had been returned to the government by early 2011. In January 2009 the US Congress passed and President Barack OBAMA signed a bill providing an additional $787 billion fiscal stimulus to be used over 10 years - two-thirds on additional spending and one-third on tax cuts - to create jobs and to help the economy recover. Approximately two-thirds of these funds were injected into the economy by the end of 2010. In March 2010, President OBAMA signed a health insurance reform bill into law that will extend coverage to an additional 32 million American citizens by 2016, through private health insurance for the general population and Medicaid for the impoverished. In July 2010, the president signed the DODD-FRANK Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, a bill designed to promote financial stability by protecting consumers from financial abuses, ending taxpayer bailouts of financial firms, dealing with troubled banks that are \"too big to fail,\" and improving accountability and transparency in the financial system - in particular, by requiring certain financial derivatives to be traded in markets that are subject to government regulation and oversight. In November 2010, in an attempt to keep interest rates from rising and snuffing out the nascent recovery, the US Federal Reserve Bank (The Fed) announced that it would purchase $600 billion worth of US Government bonds by June 2011.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":14660000000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":14660000000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":2.8,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":1.2,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":22.2,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":76.7,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":{"Labor force":154900000,"country comparison to the world:":""},"Labor force - by occupation":{"farming, forestry, and fishing:":{"quantity":0.7,"unit":"%"},"manufacturing, extraction, transportation, and crafts:":{"quantity":20.3,"unit":"%"},"managerial, professional, and technical:":{"quantity":37.3,"unit":"%"},"sales and office:":{"quantity":24.2,"unit":"%"},"other services:":{"quantity":17.6,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":9.7,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":12,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":2,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":30,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":45,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":12.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":2092000000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":3397000000000}},"Public debt":{"Public debt":{"quantity":58.9,"unit":"% of GDP"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1.4,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":0.5,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":3.25,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":1740000000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":12390000000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":32610000000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":15080000000000},"Agriculture - products":"wheat, corn, other grains, fruits, vegetables, cotton;

Current concerns include terrorism by Islamic militants, economic stagnation, and the curtailment of human rights and democratization.","geo":{"Location":"Central Asia, north of Turkmenistan, south of Kazakhstan","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":41,"min":0},"E":{"deg":64,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total:":{"quantity":447400,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world:":"","land:":{"quantity":425400,"unit":"sq km"},"water:":{"quantity":22000,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly larger than California","Land boundaries":{"total:":{"quantity":6221,"unit":"km"},"border countries:":"Afghanistan 137 km, Kazakhstan 2,203 km, Kyrgyzstan 1,099 km, Tajikistan 1,161 km, Turkmenistan 1,621 km"},"Coastline":"0 km (doubly landlocked);

11% of the land is intensely cultivated, in irrigated river valleys. More than 60% of the population lives in densely populated rural communities. Export of hydrocarbons, including natural gas and petroleum, provided about 40% of foreign exchange earnings in 2009. Other major export earners include gold and cotton. Uzbekistan is now the world's second-largest cotton exporter and fifth largest producer; it has come under increasing international criticism for the use of child labor in its annual cotton harvest. Nevertheless, Uzbekistan enjoyed a bumper cotton crop in 2010 amidst record high prices. Following independence in September 1991, the government sought to prop up its Soviet-style command economy with subsidies and tight controls on production and prices. While aware of the need to improve the investment climate, the government still sponsors measures that often increase, not decrease, its control over business decisions. A sharp increase in the inequality of income distribution has hurt the lower ranks of society since independence. In 2003, the government accepted Article VIII obligations under the IMF, providing for full currency convertibility. However, strict currency controls and tightening of borders have lessened the effects of convertibility and have also led to some shortages that have further stifled economic activity. The Central Bank often delays or restricts convertibility, especially for consumer goods. Potential investment by Russia and China in Uzbekistan's gas and oil industry, as well as increased cooperation with South Korea in the realm of civil aviation, may boost growth prospects. However, decreased demand for natural gas in Europe and Russia in the wake of the global financial crisis could reduce energy-related revenues in the near term. In November 2005, Russian President Vladimir PUTIN and Uzbekistan President KARIMOV signed an \"alliance,\" which included provisions for economic and business cooperation. Russian businesses have shown increased interest in Uzbekistan, especially in mining, telecom, and oil and gas. In 2006, Uzbekistan took steps to rejoin the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) and the Eurasian Economic Community (EurASEC), which it subsequently left in 2008, both organizations dominated by Russia. In the past Uzbek authorities had accused US and other foreign companies operating in Uzbekistan of violating Uzbek tax laws and have frozen their assets, but no new expropriations occurred in 2008-09. Instead, the Uzbek Government has actively courted several major U.S. and international corporations, offering attractive financing and tax advantages, and has landed a significant US investment in the automotive industry. Although growth slowed in 2009-10, Uzbekistan has seen few other effects from the global economic downturn, primarily due to its relative isolation from the global financial markets.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":85850000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":38990000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":8.5,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":21.2,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":32.3,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":46.4,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":16000000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":44,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":20,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":36,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":1.1,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":26,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":2.8,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":29.6,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":36.8,"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":12250000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":12300000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":9,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":15,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":4895000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":7197000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":6482000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA (31 December 2010)","Agriculture - products":"cotton, vegetables, fruits, grain; livestock","Industries":"textiles, food processing, machine building, metallurgy, gold, petroleum, natural gas, chemicals","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":8,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":44800000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":40100000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":11520000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":11440000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":70910,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":145000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":6104,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":35810,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":594000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":67599999999.99999,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":52600000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":15000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":1841000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":5588000000},"Exports":{"usd":13130000000},"Exports - commodities":"energy products, cotton, gold, mineral fertilizers, ferrous and nonferrous metals, textiles, food products, machinery, automobiles","Exports - partners":"Ukraine 29.91%, Russia 13.94%, Turkey 7.53%, Kazakhstan 7.26%, Bangladesh 6.83%, China 5.69%, South Korea 4.19% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":9440000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery and equipment, foodstuffs, chemicals, ferrous and nonferrous metals","Imports - partners":"Russia 23.72%, China 20.36%, South Korea 13.03%, Germany 6.09%, Ukraine 5.39%, Kazakhstan 4.68% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":10500000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":4236000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":"$NA","Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA","Exchange rates":"Uzbekistani soum (UZS) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"vc","name":"Saint Vincent and the Grenadines","region":"Central America and Caribbean","background":"Resistance by native Caribs prevented colonization on Saint Vincent until 1719.

A nationwide strike between December 2002 and February 2003 had far-reaching economic consequences - real GDP declined by around 9% in 2002 and 8% in 2003 - but economic output recovered strongly through 2008. Fueled by high oil prices, record government spending helped to boost GDP by about 10% in 2006, 8% in 2007, and nearly 5% in 2008, before a sharp drop in oil prices caused a contraction in 2009-10. This spending, combined with recent minimum wage hikes and improved access to domestic credit, created a consumption boom which came at the cost of higher inflation - roughly 32% in 2008, and slowing only slightly to 30% in 2010, despite the lengthy downturn. Imports also jumped significantly before the recession of 2009. President Hugo CHAVEZ's continued efforts to increase the government's control of the economy by nationalizing firms in the agribusiness, financial, construction, oil, and steel sectors have hurt the private investment environment, reduced productive capacity, and slowed non-petroleum exports. In the first half of 2010 Venezuela faced the prospect of lengthy nationwide blackouts when its main hydroelectric power plant - which provides more than 35% of the country's electricity - nearly shut down. In May, 2010, CHAVEZ closed the unofficial foreign exchange market - the \"parallel\" market - in an effort to stem inflation and slow the currency's depreciation. In June 2010, the government created the \"Transaction System for Foreign Currency Denominated Securities\" (SITME) to replace the \"parallel\" market. In December 2010, CHAVEZ eliminated the dual exchange rate system and unified the exchange rate at 4.3 bolivars per dollar. In January 2011, CHAVEZ announced the second devaluation of the bolivar within twelve months. In December 2010, the National Assembly passed a package of five organic laws designed to complete the transformation of the Venezuelan economy in line with CHAVEZ's vision of 21st century socialism. These laws likely will be implemented in 2011. Venezuela began 2011 wrestling with macroeconomic imbalances resulting from the government's unorthodox economic policies, a housing crisis, and a continuing electricity crisis.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":345200000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":290700000000},"GDP - real growth rate":"-1.9% (2010 est.)","GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":4.1,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":34.9,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":61.1,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":13300000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":13,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":23,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":64,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":12.1,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":37.9,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":1.7,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":32.7,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":41,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":16.4,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":50120000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":56530000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":25.5,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":29.8,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":29.5,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":19.89,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":69360000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":78110000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":54220000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA (31 December 2010)","Agriculture - products":"corn, sorghum, sugarcane, rice, bananas, vegetables, coffee; beef, pork, milk, eggs; fish","Industries":"petroleum, construction materials, food processing, textiles; iron ore mining, steel, aluminum; motor vehicle assembly","Industrial production growth rate":"-8% (2010 est.)","Electricity - production":{"quantity":113300000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":83020000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":540000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":1651000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":2472000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":740000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":2182000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":97770000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":23060000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":24860000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":1800000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":4983000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":22070000000},"Exports":{"usd":64870000000.00001},"Exports - commodities":"petroleum, bauxite and aluminum, minerals, chemicals, agricultural products, basic manufactures","Exports - partners":"US 27.3%, Columbia 11.4%, China 12.8%, Brazil 8.8% (2009 est.)","Imports":{"usd":31370000000},"Imports - commodities":"agricultural products, raw materials, machinery and equipment, transport equipment, construction materials","Imports - partners":"US 20.6%, Columbia 17.8%, China 12.8%, Mexico 8.7%, Brazil 4.7% (2009 est.)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":29490000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":55610000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":37710000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":20970000000},"Exchange rates":"bolivars (VEB) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"vi","name":"British Virgin Islands","region":"Central America and Caribbean","background":"First inhabited by Arawak and later by Carib Indians, the Virgin Islands were settled by the Dutch in 1648 and then annexed by the English in 1672.

Under the Geneva Accords of 1954, Vietnam was divided into the Communist North and anti-Communist South. US economic and military aid to South Vietnam grew through the 1960s in an attempt to bolster the government, but US armed forces were withdrawn following a cease-fire agreement in 1973. Two years later, North Vietnamese forces overran the South reuniting the country under Communist rule. Despite the return of peace, for over a decade the country experienced little economic growth because of conservative leadership policies, the persecution and mass exodus of individuals - many of them successful South Vietnamese merchants - and growing international isolation. However, since the enactment of Vietnam's \"doi moi\" (renovation) policy in 1986, Vietnamese authorities have committed to increased economic liberalization and enacted structural reforms needed to modernize the economy and to produce more competitive, export-driven industries. The Communist leaders, however, maintain control on political expression and have resisted outside calls to improve human rights. The country continues to experience small-scale protests from various groups, the vast majority connected to land-use issues, calls for increased political space and the lack of equitable mechanisms for resolving disputes. Various ethnic minorities, such as the Montagnards of the Central Highlands and the Khmer Krom in the southern delta region, have also held protests.","geo":{"Location":"Southeastern Asia, bordering the Gulf of Thailand, Gulf of Tonkin, and South China Sea, as well as China, Laos, and Cambodia","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":16,"min":10},"E":{"deg":107,"min":50}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total:":{"quantity":331210,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world:":"","land:":{"quantity":310070,"unit":"sq km"},"water:":{"quantity":21140,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly larger than New Mexico","Land boundaries":{"total:":{"quantity":4639,"unit":"km"},"border countries:":"Cambodia 1,228 km, China 1,281 km, Laos 2,130 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":3444,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea:":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone:":{"quantity":24,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone:":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf:":"200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin"},"Climate":"tropical in south;

While Vietnam's economy remains dominated by state-owned enterprises (SOEs), which still produce about 40% of GDP, Vietnamese authorities have reaffirmed their commitment to economic liberalization and international integration. They have moved to implement the structural reforms needed to modernize the economy and to produce more competitive export-driven industries. Vietnam joined the WTO in January 2007 following more than a decade-long negotiation process. Vietnam became an official negotiating partner in the developing Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement in 2010. Agriculture's share of economic output has continued to shrink from about 25% in 2000 to about 20% in 2010, while industry's share increased from 36% to 41% in the same period. Deep poverty has declined significantly and Vietnam is working to create jobs to meet the challenge of a labor force that is growing by more than one million people every year. The global recession has hurt Vietnam's export-oriented economy, with GDP in 2009-10 growing less than the 7% per annum average achieved during the last decade. In 2010, exports increased by more than 25%, year-on-year, but the trade deficit remained high, prompting the government to consider administrative measures to limit the trade deficit. Vietnam's managed currency, the dong, continues to face downward pressure due to a persistent trade imbalance, and, since 2008, the government devalued it by 20% through a series of small devaluations. Foreign donors pledged nearly $8 billion in new development assistance for 2011. However, the government's strong growth-oriented economic policies have caused it to struggle to control one of the region's highest inflation rates, which reached 11.8% in 2010. Vietnam's economy also faces challenges from falling foreign exchange reserves, an undercapitalized banking sector, and high borrowing costs.

Mining accounts for 8% of GDP, but provides more than 50% of foreign exchange earnings. Rich alluvial diamond deposits make Namibia a primary source for gem-quality diamonds. Namibia is the world's fourth-largest producer of uranium. It also produces large quantities of zinc and is a small producer of gold and other minerals. The mining sector employs only about 3% of the population while about 35-40% of the population depends on subsistence agriculture for its livelihood. Namibia normally imports about 50% of its cereal requirements; in drought years food shortages are a major problem in rural areas. A high per capita GDP, relative to the region, hides one of the world's most unequal income distributions, as shown by Namibia's 70.7 GINI coefficient. The Namibian economy is closely linked to South Africa with the Namibian dollar pegged one-to-one to the South African rand. Until 2010, Namibia drew 40% of its budget revenues from the Southern African Customs Union (SACU). Increased payments from SACU put Namibia's budget into surplus in 2007 for the first time since independence. SACU allotments to Namibia increased in 2009, but will drop for 2010 and 2011 because South Africa went into recession during the global economic crisis, reducing overall SACU income. Increased fish production and mining of zinc, copper, and uranium spurred growth in 2003-08, but growth in recent years was undercut by poor fish catches, a dramatic decline in demand for diamonds, higher costs of producing metals, and the global recession. A rebound in diamond and uranium prices in 2010 provided a significant boost to Namibia's mining sector. Copper mines, which closed in 2008, are slated to reopen in 2011.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":14600000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":11870000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":4.4,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":9,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":32.7,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":58.2,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":729000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":16.3,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":22.4,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":61.3,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":51.2,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":55.8,"unit":"%"}},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":1.1,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":53,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":70.7,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":24,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":2977000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":3817000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":20,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":4.6,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":7,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":11.12,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":3049000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":4756000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":5122000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":846300000},"Agriculture - products":"millet, sorghum, peanuts, grapes; livestock; fish","Industries":"meatpacking, fish processing, dairy products; mining (diamonds, lead, zinc, tin, silver, tungsten, uranium, copper)","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":6.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":1491000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":2845000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":40000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":2045000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":22000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":19120,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":62290000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-187 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":4277000000},"Exports - commodities":"diamonds, copper, gold, zinc, lead, uranium; cattle, processed fish, karakul skins","Imports":{"usd":5152000000},"Imports - commodities":"foodstuffs; petroleum products and fuel, machinery and equipment, chemicals","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":1961000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":2373000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":"$NA","Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA","Exchange rates":"Namibian dollars (NAD) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"we","name":"West Bank","region":"Middle East","background":"The September 1993 Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements provided for a transitional period of Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Under a series of agreements signed between May 1994 and September 1999, Israel transferred to the Palestinian Authority (PA) security and civilian responsibility for many Palestinian-populated areas of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Negotiations to determine the permanent status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip stalled following the outbreak of an intifada in September 2000. In April 2003, the Quartet (US, EU, UN, and Russia) presented a roadmap to a final settlement of the conflict by 2005 based on reciprocal steps by the two parties leading to two states, Israel and a democratic Palestine. Following Palestinian leader Yasir ARAFAT's death in late 2004, Mahmud ABBAS was elected PA president in January 2005. A month later, Israel and the PA agreed to the Sharm el-Sheikh Commitments in an effort to move the peace process forward. In September 2005, Israel unilaterally withdrew all its settlers and soldiers and dismantled its military facilities in the Gaza Strip and withdrew settlers and redeployed soldiers from four small northern West Bank settlements. Nonetheless, Israel still controls maritime, airspace, and most access to the Gaza Strip. In January 2006, the Islamic Resistance Movement, HAMAS, won control of the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC). HAMAS took control of the PA government in March 2006, but President ABBAS had little success negotiating with HAMAS to present a political platform acceptable to the international community so as to lift economic sanctions on Palestinians. Violent clashes between Fatah and HAMAS supporters in the Gaza Strip in 2006 and early 2007 resulted in numerous Palestinian deaths and injuries. In February 2007, ABBAS and HAMAS Political Bureau Chief MISHAL signed the Mecca Agreement in Saudi Arabia that resulted in the formation of a Palestinian National Unity Government (NUG) headed by HAMAS member Ismail HANIYA. However, fighting continued in the Gaza Strip, and in June 2007, HAMAS militants succeeded in a violent takeover of all military and governmental institutions in the Gaza Strip. ABBAS dismissed the NUG and through a series of presidential decrees formed a PA government in the West Bank led by independent Salam FAYYAD. HAMAS rejected the NUG's dismissal, and despite multiple rounds of Egyptian-brokered reconciliation negotiations, the two groups have failed to bridge their differences. The status quo remains with HAMAS in control of the Gaza Strip and ABBAS and the Fatah-dominated PA governing the West Bank. FAYYAD and his PA government continue to implement a series of security and economic reforms to improve conditions in the West Bank. ABBAS has said he will not resume negotiations with current Prime Minister NETANYAHU until Israel halts all settlement activity in the West Bank and Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n\r\n","geo":{"Location":"Middle East, west of Jordan, east of Israel","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":32,"min":0},"E":{"deg":35,"min":15}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total:":{"quantity":5860,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world:":"","land:":{"quantity":5640,"unit":"sq km"},"water:":{"quantity":220,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than Delaware","Land boundaries":{"total:":{"quantity":404,"unit":"km"},"border countries:":"Israel 307 km, Jordan 97 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":"none (landlocked)","Climate":"temperate; temperature and precipitation vary with altitude, warm to hot summers, cool to mild winters","Terrain":"mostly rugged dissected upland, some vegetation in west, but barren in east","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point:":"Dead Sea -408 m","highest point:":"Tall Asur 1,022 m"},"Natural resources":"arable land","Land use":{"arable land:":{"quantity":16.9,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops:":{"quantity":18.97,"unit":"%"},"other:":{"quantity":64.13,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":"180 sq km; note - includes Gaza Strip (2003)","Natural hazards":"droughts","Environment - current issues":"adequacy of freshwater supply; sewage treatment","Geography - note":"landlocked; highlands are main recharge area for Israel's coastal aquifers; there are about 355 Israeli civilian sites including about 145 small outpost communities in the West Bank and 32 sites in East Jerusalem (2010 est.)"},"people":{"Population":{"Population":2568,"country comparison to the world:":""},"Age structure":{"0-14 years:":{"quantity":35.8,"unit":"%"},"15-64 years:":{"quantity":60.5,"unit":"%"},"65 years and over:":"3.7% (male 39,546/female 55,637) (2011 est.)"},"Median age":{"total:":{"quantity":21.3,"unit":"years"},"male:":{"quantity":21.1,"unit":"years"},"female:":{"quantity":21.5,"unit":"years"}},"Population growth rate":{"quantity":2.097,"unit":"%"},"Birth rate":{"quantity":24.56,"unit":"births/1,000 population"},"Death rate":{"quantity":3.58,"unit":"deaths/1,000 population"},"Net migration rate":{"quantity":0,"unit":"migrant(s)/1,000 population"},"Urbanization":{"urban population:":{"quantity":72,"unit":"% of total population"},"rate of urbanization:":{"quantity":3.3,"unit":"% annual rate of change"}},"Sex ratio":{"at birth:":{"quantity":1.06,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"under 15 years:":{"quantity":1.05,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"15-64 years:":{"quantity":1.05,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"65 years and over:":{"quantity":0.71,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"total population:":{"quantity":1.04,"unit":"male(s)/female"}},"Infant mortality rate":{"total:":{"quantity":14.92,"unit":"deaths/1,000 live births"},"country comparison to the world:":"","male:":{"quantity":16.73,"unit":"deaths/1,000 live births"},"female:":{"quantity":13.01,"unit":"deaths/1,000 live births"}},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population:":{"quantity":75.01,"unit":"years"},"country comparison to the world:":"","male:":{"quantity":72.97,"unit":"years"},"female:":{"quantity":77.17,"unit":"years"}},"Total fertility rate":{"quantity":3.05,"unit":"children born/woman"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":"NA","HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":"NA","HIV/AIDS - deaths":"NA","Nationality":{"noun:":"NA","adjective:":"NA"},"Ethnic groups":"Palestinian Arab and other 83%, Jewish 17%","Religions":"Muslim 75% (predominantly Sunni), Jewish 17%, Christian and other 8%","Languages":"Arabic, Hebrew (spoken by Israeli settlers and many Palestinians), English (widely understood)","Literacy":{"definition:":"age 15 and over can read and write","total population:":{"quantity":92.4,"unit":"%"},"male:":{"quantity":96.7,"unit":"%"},"female:":{"quantity":88,"unit":"%"}},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":{"total:":{"quantity":14,"unit":"years"},"male:":{"quantity":13,"unit":"years"},"female:":{"quantity":14,"unit":"years"}},"Education expenditures":"NA"},"economy":{"Economy - overview":"The West Bank - the larger of the two areas comprising the Palestinian territories - experienced a high single-digit economic growth rate in 2010 as a result of inflows of donor aid, the Palestinian Authority's (PA) implementation of economic and security reforms, and the easing of some movement and access restrictions by the Israeli Government. Nevertheless, overall standard-of-living measures remain near levels seen prior to the start of the second intifada in 2000. The almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of Israeli closure policies - a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the West Bank in response to Israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows, industrial capacity, and basic commerce, both external and internal. Since 2008, the PA under President Mahmoud ABBAS and Prime Minister Salam FAYYAD has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance, supported by more than $3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the PA's budget since 2007. An easing of some Israeli restrictions on West Bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities. The biggest impediments to economic improvements in the West Bank remain Palestinians' lack of access to land and resources in Israeli-controlled areas, import and export restrictions, and a high-cost capital structure. Absent robust private sector growth, the PA will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":12790000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":6641000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":7,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":5,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":14,"unit":"%"},"services:":"81% (includes Gaza Strip) (2008 est.)"},"Labor force":694000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":12,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":23,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":65,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":16.5,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":46,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":"NA%","highest 10%:":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":1870000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":3100000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":3.5,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":5.78,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":"$NA (31 December 2008)","Stock of broad money":{"usd":5567000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":1800000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA (31 December 2009)","Agriculture - products":"olives, citrus fruit, vegetables; beef, dairy products","Industries":"small-scale manufacturing, quarrying, textiles, soap, olive-wood carvings, and mother-of-pearl souvenirs","Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Electricity - production":{"Electricity - production":{"quantity":500000000,"unit":"kWh"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":3265000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":2800000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":24000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":511,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":22150,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Exports":{"Exports":{"usd":529000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Exports - commodities":"stone, olives, fruit, vegetables, limestone","Imports":{"usd":3772000000},"Imports - commodities":"food, consumer goods, construction materials, petroleum, chemicals","Debt - external":{"usd":1040000000},"Exchange rates":"new Israeli shekels (ILS) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"wf","name":"Wallis and Futuna","region":"Australia-Oceania","background":"The Futuna island group was discovered by the Dutch in 1616 and Wallis by the British in 1767, but it was the French who declared a protectorate over the islands in 1842, and took official control of them between 1886 and 1888.

The manufacturing sector has diversified since the mid-1980s. Sugar and wood pulp were major foreign exchange earners; however, the wood pulp producer closed in January 2010, and sugar is now the main export earner. In 2007, the sugar industry increased efficiency and diversification efforts, in response to a 17% decline in EU sugar prices. Mining has declined in importance in recent years with only coal and quarry stone mines remaining active. Surrounded by South Africa, except for a short border with Mozambique, Swaziland is heavily dependent on South Africa from which it receives more than nine-tenths of its imports and to which it sends 60% of its exports. Swaziland's currency is pegged to the South African rand, subsuming Swaziland's monetary policy to South Africa. The government is heavily dependent on customs duties from the Southern African Customs Union (SACU), and worker remittances from South Africa substantially supplement domestically earned income. The government has also legislated that 30% of local pension funds need to be invested in Swaziland, boosting demand for government bonds. Customs revenues plummeted due to the global economic crisis and a drop in South African imports. The resulting decline in revenue has pushed the country into a fiscal crisis. The government has requested assistance from the IMF and from the African Development Bank. With an estimated 40% unemployment rate, Swaziland's need to increase the number and size of small and medium enterprises and attract foreign direct investment is acute. Overgrazing, soil depletion, drought, and floods persist as problems for the future. More than one-fourth of the population needed emergency food aid in 2006-07 because of drought, and more than one-quarter of the adult population has been infected by HIV/AIDS.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":6067000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":3553000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":2,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":8.6,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":42,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":49.4,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":457900,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":70,"unit":"%"},"industry:":"NA%","services:":"NA%"},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":40,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":69,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":1.6,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":40.7,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":50.4,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":12.6,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":961700000},"expenditures:":{"usd":1379000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":5,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":6.5,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":11.38,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":335700000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":1266000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":258500000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA (31 December 2009)","Agriculture - products":"sugarcane, cotton, corn, tobacco, rice, citrus, pineapples, sorghum, peanuts; cattle, goats, sheep","Industries":"coal, wood pulp, sugar, soft drink concentrates, textiles and apparel","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":1,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":441000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":1266000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":"770 million kWh; note - electricity supplied by South Africa (2008 est.)","Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":4000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":4100,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-374 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":1417000000},"Exports - commodities":"soft drink concentrates, sugar, wood pulp, cotton yarn, refrigerators, citrus and canned fruit","Imports":{"usd":1643000000},"Imports - commodities":"motor vehicles, machinery, transport equipment, foodstuffs, petroleum products, chemicals","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":708000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":497000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":"$NA","Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA","Exchange rates":"emalangeni per US dollar -"}},{"id":"xo","name":"Indian Ocean","background":"The Indian Ocean is the third largest of the world's five oceans (after the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean, but larger than the Southern Ocean and Arctic Ocean).

Three years later, the southern government adopted a Marxist orientation. The massive exodus of hundreds of thousands of Yemenis from the south to the north contributed to two decades of hostility between the states. The two countries were formally unified as the Republic of Yemen in 1990. A southern secessionist movement in 1994 was quickly subdued. In 2000, Saudi Arabia and Yemen agreed to a delimitation of their border. Fighting in the northwest between the government and Huthi rebels, a group seeking a return to traditional Zaydi Islam, began in 2004 and has since resulted in seven rounds of fighting - the last ended in early 2010 with a tentative ceasefire. The southern secessionist movement was revitalized in 2008 when a popular socioeconomic protest movement initiated the prior year took on political goals including secession. Public rallies in Sana'a against President SALIH - inspired by similar demonstrations in Tunisia and Egypt - slowly built momentum starting in late January 2011 fueled by complaints over high unemployment, poor economic conditions, and corruption. By the following month, some protests had resulted in violence, and the demonstrations had spread to other major cities. By March the opposition had hardened its demands and was unifying behind calls for SALIH's immediate ouster. Media reports indicated that as many as 100 protesters had been killed and many more injured amid the protests.

In October 2009, Yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort. In January 2010, the international community established the Friends of Yemen group that aims to support Yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform, and in August 2010 the IMF approved a three-year $370 million program to further this effort. Despite these ambitious endeavors, Yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges, including declining water resources and a high population growth rate.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":63400000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":31270000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":8,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":8.2,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":38.8,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":53,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":6832000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"note:":"most people are employed in agriculture and herding; services, construction, industry, and commerce account for less than one-fourth of the labor force"},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":35,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":45.2,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":2.9,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":30.8,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":37.7,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":19.4,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":7581000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":9345000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":39.1,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":12.2,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":"NA%","Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":18,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":3551000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":9739000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":5297000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Agriculture - products":"grain, fruits, vegetables, pulses, qat, coffee, cotton; dairy products, livestock (sheep, goats, cattle, camels), poultry; fish","Industries":"crude oil production and petroleum refining; small-scale production of cotton textiles and leather goods; food processing; handicrafts; small aluminum products factory; cement; commercial ship repair; natural gas production","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":9,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":5665000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":4133000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":288400,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":155000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":274400,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":65860,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":3160000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":454700,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":454700,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":478500000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-2.181 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":7462000000},"Exports - commodities":"crude oil, coffee, dried and salted fish, liquefied natural gas","Exports - partners":"China 36%, Thailand 17.63%, India 13.54%, South Africa 6.16%, Japan 5.49%, UAE 4.99% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":8350000000},"Imports - commodities":"food and live animals, machinery and equipment, chemicals","Imports - partners":"China 13.98%, UAE 12.3%, India 8.63%, Saudi Arabia 5.8%, US 4.52%, Brazil 4.51%, Turkey 4.51%, Kuwait 4.33%, France 4.24% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":5744000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":7147000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":"$NA","Exchange rates":"Yemeni rials (YER) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"za","name":"Zambia","region":"Africa","background":"The territory of Northern Rhodesia was administered by the [British] South Africa Company from 1891 until it was taken over by the UK in 1923.

Elections in 1991 brought an end to one-party rule, but the subsequent vote in 1996 saw blatant harassment of opposition parties.

The new president launched an anticorruption investigation in 2002 to probe high-level corruption during the previous administration. In 2006-07, this task force successfully prosecuted four cases, including a landmark civil case in the UK in which former President CHILUBA and numerous others were found liable for more than USD 41 million. MWANAWASA was reelected in 2006 in an election that was deemed free and fair.

Privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly increased copper mining output and profitability to spur economic growth. Copper output has increased steadily since 2004, due to higher copper prices and foreign investment. In 2005, Zambia qualified for debt relief under the Highly Indebted Poor Country Initiative, consisting of approximately USD 6 billion in debt relief. Poverty remains a significant problem in Zambia, despite a stronger economy. Zambia's dependency on copper makes it vulnerable to depressed commodity prices, but record high copper prices and a bumper maize crop in 2010 helped Zambia rebound quickly from the world economic slowdown that began in 2008. A high birth rate, relatively high HIV/AIDS burden, and market distorting agricultural policies have meant that Zambia's economic growth has not dramatically decreased the stubbornly high poverty rates.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":20040000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":16190000000.000002},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":7.6,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":19.7,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":33.7,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":46.6,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":5524000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":85,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":6,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":9,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":14,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":64,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":1.2,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":38.8,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":50.8,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":20.5,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":3200000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":3743000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":24.1,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":8.5,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":8.39,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":22.06,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":1234000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":3573000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":2992000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA (31 December 2010)","Agriculture - products":"corn, sorghum, rice, peanuts, sunflower seed, vegetables, flowers, tobacco, cotton, sugarcane, cassava (tapioca), coffee; cattle, goats, pigs, poultry, milk, eggs, hides","Industries":"copper mining and processing, construction, foodstuffs, beverages, chemicals, textiles, fertilizer, horticulture","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":12.1,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":9752000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":8838000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":268000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":222000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":159.5,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":16000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":275.3,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":14730,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-99 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":6463000000},"Exports - commodities":"copper/cobalt 64%, cobalt, electricity; tobacco, flowers, cotton","Exports - partners":"China 21.37%, Saudi Arabia 8.93%, Democratic Republic of the Congo 8.55%, South Korea 8.32%, Egypt 8.08%, South Africa 6.96%, India 5% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":4949000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery, transportation equipment, petroleum products, electricity, fertilizer, foodstuffs, clothing","Imports - partners":"South Africa 51.78%, UAE 7.7%, China 5.85%, Democratic Republic of the Congo 4.22% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":2287000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":3495000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":"$NA","Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA","Exchange rates":"Zambian kwacha (ZMK) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"zh","name":"Atlantic Ocean","background":"The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's five oceans (after the Pacific Ocean, but larger than the Indian Ocean, Southern Ocean, and Arctic Ocean).

A 1961 constitution was formulated that favored whites in power. In 1965 the government unilaterally declared its independence, but the UK did not recognize the act and demanded more complete voting rights for the black African majority in the country (then called Rhodesia). UN sanctions and a guerrilla uprising finally led to free elections in 1979 and independence (as Zimbabwe) in 1980. Robert MUGABE, the nation's first prime minister, has been the country's only ruler (as president since 1987) and has dominated the country's political system since independence. His chaotic land redistribution campaign, which began in 2000, caused an exodus of white farmers, crippled the economy, and ushered in widespread shortages of basic commodities. Ignoring international condemnation, MUGABE rigged the 2002 presidential election to ensure his reelection. The ruling ZANU-PF party used fraud and intimidation to win a two-thirds majority in the March 2005 parliamentary election, allowing it to amend the constitution at will and recreate the Senate, which had been abolished in the late 1980s. In April 2005, Harare embarked on Operation Restore Order, ostensibly an urban rationalization program, which resulted in the destruction of the homes or businesses of 700,000 mostly poor supporters of the opposition. President MUGABE in June 2007 instituted price controls on all basic commodities causing panic buying and leaving store shelves empty for months. General elections held in March 2008 contained irregularities but still amounted to a censure of the ZANU-PF-led government with the opposition winning a majority of seats in parliament. MDC opposition leader Morgan TSVANGIRAI won the most votes in the presidential polls, but not enough to win outright. In the lead up to a run-off election in late June 2008, considerable violence enacted against opposition party members led to the withdrawal of TSVANGIRAI from the ballot. Extensive evidence of violence and intimidation resulted in international condemnation of the process. Difficult negotiations over a power-sharing government, in which MUGABE remained president and TSVANGIRAI became prime minister, were finally settled in February 2009, although the leaders have yet failed to agree upon many key outstanding governmental issues. Mugabe in October publicly called for early elections in 2011-two years before his term ends-but no election date has been set.","geo":{"Location":"Southern Africa, between South Africa and Zambia","Geographic coordinates":{"S":{"deg":20,"min":0},"E":{"deg":30,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total:":{"quantity":390757,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world:":"","land:":{"quantity":386847,"unit":"sq km"},"water:":{"quantity":3910,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly larger than Montana","Land boundaries":{"total:":{"quantity":3066,"unit":"km"},"border countries:":"Botswana 813 km, Mozambique 1,231 km, South Africa 225 km, Zambia 797 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":"none (landlocked)","Climate":"tropical;

Following a decade of contraction, Zimbabwe's economy recorded real growth of 5.9% in 2010. But the government of Zimbabwe still faces a number of difficult economic problems, including a large external debt burden and insufficient formal employment. Zimbabwe's 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy. The government's land reform program, characterized by chaos and violence, has badly damaged the commercial farming sector, the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs, turning Zimbabwe into a net importer of food products. The EU and the US provide food aid on humanitarian grounds, though on a smaller scale than before. Until early 2009, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit, causing hyperinflation. The power-sharing government formed in February 2009 has led to some economic improvements, including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the Zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls. The economy is registering its first growth in a decade, but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":5457000000},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":7474000000}},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":9,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world:":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":19.5,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":24,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":56.5,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":3848000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture:":{"quantity":66,"unit":"%"},"industry:":{"quantity":10,"unit":"%"},"services:":{"quantity":24,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":95,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world:":""},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":68,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%:":{"quantity":2,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%:":{"quantity":40.4,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":50.1,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":21,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":2250000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":2250000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":149,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":5.03,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":"NA% (31 December 2010)","Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":10,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"Stock of narrow money":"$NA (31 December 2010 est.)"},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":3057000},"Stock of domestic credit":"$NA","Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":4470000000},"Agriculture - products":"corn, cotton, tobacco, wheat, coffee, sugarcane, peanuts; sheep, goats, pigs","Industries":"mining (coal, gold, platinum, copper, nickel, tin, diamonds, clay, numerous metallic and nonmetallic ores), steel; wood products, cement, chemicals, fertilizer, clothing and footwear, foodstuffs, beverages","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":4,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":8890000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":10890000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":32000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":2691000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":11000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":13830,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-1.503 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":2540000000},"Exports - commodities":"platinum, cotton, tobacco, gold, ferroalloys, textiles/clothing","Exports - partners":"Democratic Republic of the Congo 14.82%, South Africa 13.39%, Botswana 13.23%, China 7.82%, Zambia 7.3%, Netherlands 5.39%, UK 4.93% (2009)","Imports":{"usd":4043000000},"Imports - commodities":"machinery and transport equipment, other manufactures, chemicals, fuels, food products","Imports - partners":"South Africa 62.24%, China 4.2% (2009)","Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":376000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":7662000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":"$NA","Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA","Exchange rates":"Zimbabwean dollars (ZWD) per US dollar -"}},{"id":"zn","name":"Pacific Ocean","background":"The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the world's five oceans (followed by the Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Southern Ocean, and Arctic Ocean).

Exploitation of offshore oil and gas reserves is playing an ever-increasing role in the energy supplies of the US, Australia, NZ, China, and Peru. The high cost of recovering offshore oil and gas, combined with the wide swings in world prices for oil since 1985, has led to fluctuations in new drillings."}}]}
